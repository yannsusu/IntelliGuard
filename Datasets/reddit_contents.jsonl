[**Psychology Today has one too**](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202008/three-popular-myths-about-transgender-youth), and  [**here**](http://assets2.hrc.org/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) are the guidelines from the AAP. TL;DR version - yes, young children can identify their own gender, and some of those young kids are trans. A child who is Gender A but who is assumed to be Gender B based on their visible anatomy at birth can suffer debilitating distress over this conflict. The *\"90% desist\"* claim is a myth based on debunked studies, and transition is a very long, slow, cautious process for trans youth.\n\nAccording to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/), but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes the gender expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearance. The genders of trans children are as [**stable**](http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/09/02/peds.2013-2958) as those of [**cisgender children**](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614568156).\n\nFor preadolescents transition is entirely social, and for adolescents the first line of medical care is temporary, reversible puberty delaying treatment that has no long term effects. Hormone therapy isn't an option until their mid teens, by which point the chances that they will \"desist\" are close to zero. Reconstructive genital surgery is not an option until their late teens/early 20's at the youngest.\n\nAnd transition-related medical care is recognized as medically necessary, frequently life saving medical care by every major medical authority. \n\nThe only disorders more common among trans people are those associated with abuse and discrimination - mainly anxiety and depression. Early transition [**virtually eliminates these higher rates of depression and low self-worth**](http://www.jaacap.com/article/S0890-8567%2816%2931941-4/fulltext), and [**dramatically improves trans youth's mental health**](https://thinkprogress.org/allowing-transgender-youth-to-transition-improves-their-mental-health-study-finds-dd6096523375/#.pqspdcee0). When prevented from transitioning about 40% of trans kids will attempt suicide. When able to transition that rate drops to the national average. Trans kids who socially transition early, have access to appropriate transition related medical treatment, and who are not subjected to abuse or discrimination are [**comparable to cisgender children in measures of mental health**](https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/134/4/696)\n\nTransition [**vastly reduces risks of suicide attempts**](https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-015-1867-2), and the farther along in transition someone is the lower that risk gets. The ability to transition, along with family and social acceptance, are the [**largest factors reducing suicide risk among trans people**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3722435/).\nAccording to the [**American Academy of Pediatrics**](https://www.healthychildren.org/English/ages-stages/gradeschool/Pages/Gender-Identity-and-Gender-Confusion-In-Children.aspx), gender identity is typically expressed by around age 4. It probably forms [**much earlier**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3747736/) than that, but it's hard to tell with pre-verbal infants. And sometimes, the gender identity expressed is not the one typically associated with the child's appearnce.

{"type": "comment", "text": "From what I read in the article, emergency services were called because she was bleeding and passed out. She already delivered the baby and threw it in the DUMPSTER. She was in the second trimester in pregnancy and when miscarriage happens they have to induce labor or preform an abortion (which is allowed due to medical necessity even in a pro-life state) Like surely she knew what was happening and didn't seek medical attention (or never even sought out pre-natal care) then just threw the baby away which is concerning. Not saying she deserves to be arrested but to have that little compassion for your child by throwing it in the trash is crazy to me. So I can see how they would try to pursue legal action on the basis of dumping a dead body. Now knowing that it was a miscarriage they can't really go after her, but the question is, why not seek medical attention and why throw the baby away in a bag in the dumpster. The article is misleading because just reading the headline it seems like she just got arrested for having a miscarriage but in reality she was arrested because they thought she gave birth to the baby and then just threw it in the trash (we all know that has happened multiple times before ) which would actually be a crime.", "author": "corinnes-a-scorpio", "time": "2025-03-28 21:09:22", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Miscarriage/comments/1jm4qzw/be_careful_in_georgia_woman_arrested_after/mk93r84/", "label": ""}

The problem is that the owner of the lab ALSO has numerous business dealings outside of the lab with these same pain physicians. Does there need to be evidence of remuneration or is the fact that there are business relationships enough to report them to the DOJ?\n", "author": "kkissinger1978", "time": "2025-03-27 21:17:42", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthLaw/comments/1jle08g/stark_law_and_antikickback_question/", "label": ""}
