{"id": "P001", "type": "post", "text": "Serious question for people who are anti-abortion There is a percentage of the United States population that is anti-abortion, but at the same time are in favor of reducing child welfare, such as WIC as well as child care credits for daycare. The same people are often against gay people, adopting, and even single people adopting. So my serious question and not trying to stir up shit, is what do those people think will happen, or should happen, or could happen to those babies that are not aborted? I’m genuinely trying to understand other people’s point of you, so please don’t feel this thread with vitriolic hate speech.\n\nEdit: thank you to almost every single person here who presented their post in polite and measured terms. I am not going to continue answering posts because I got a little overwhelmed, but I am going to read every single one, and I really appreciate all of you. I hope that everybody who comes to this post learn some thing.\n\nEdit number two: thank you for almost everyone being civil and polite. Unfortunately, this thread is mostly made up of people who say they don’t fit in the category that I’m asking about. OK so shut up. if someone posted  a question for welders, or for French chefs, I would not go on there and say well I am not a welder or a French chef, but my opinion is solder is good and french fries are not French.  \n\nAlso, I think I got a lot out of this and I learned a lot.

{"id": "P004", "type": "post", "text": "I am an abortion abolitionist. Ask me anything. I am an abolitionist. I don't support gestational-age bans, and I believe Dobbs v. Jackson should have established equal protection for the unborn instead of returning the issue of child murder back to the states. I believe abortion should be punished just as harshly as any other homicide, and that anyone who intentionally performs or procures an abortion should face life in prison (as long as mitigating circumstances are taken into account).\n\n***Abolitionism*** *is an* ***absolutist*** *anti-abortion philosophy, often in disagreement with mainstream anti-abortion positions and organizations that are largely incrementalistic. Abortion abolitionists are in opposition to incrementalism, often opposing or criticizing laws that fall short of the complete abolition and prohibition of abortion. Abortion abolitionists have adopted the term \"abolitionist\" to separate themselves from being classified as simply \"pro-life\" and to make a moral comparison between abortion and slavery.*\n\n*Abortion abolitionists argue that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution entitles embryos and fetuses to equal protection from murder, which they believe abortion to be. In accordance with this view, abortion abolitionists support the criminalization of abortion to be similar or equal to the criminalization of murder of people after birth. This includes the belief that abortion patients ought to be prosecuted for intentionally procuring or inducing an abortion, something that the mainstream anti-abortion movement opposes.* *Abolitionists oppose exceptions for rape and incest, and they also tend to oppose IVF.*\n\n# Ask me anything. (Also, I will add my answers to FAQ below on this post as time goes on.)\n\n---\n\n**Do you support abortion-related laws that limit or restrict, but not ban abortion?**\n\nNo, I will not endorse laws that fall short of recognizing equal protection for the unborn, and therefore classifying abortion under homicide laws. And the reason why is very simple. When you make a law, you are conveying a significant message to the public. A 6-week ban on abortion, for example, conveys to the public that somehow abortion before 6-weeks is morally acceptable, and somehow humans younger than 6-weeks of gestation are not valuable of protection. Whether or not that was the intention of the writers of the bill is irrelevant, because that's what the bill conveys. Same thing with arguments to \"leave it to the states.\" If abortion is murder, then it isn't any better whether it occurs in California or Texas.\n\nTake a hypothetical law against slavery, for example. Would you support a law that said slavery is illegal and restricted until a person turns 13-years old? I wouldn't. Because by supporting that law, I would be compromising on an issue that warrants no compromising at all. Because if I supported that law, then I would be sending a message to the public that somehow slavery is morally acceptable as long as the person is 13+. If abolitionists of slavery supported that law, we'd still be stuck in an era of slavery.\n\nFor this reason, I would not support a \"restriction\" on abortion. I don't believe that abortion should be restricted or regulated, I believe it should be abolished.\n\n---\n\n**Do you support gestational age bans?**\n\nNo. If our argument as the anti-abortion movement is that human life begins at fertilization, then it makes no sense to advocate for or support laws that allow for abortion for a few weeks after that point. A zygote is no different in value than an embryo. An embryo is no different in value than a fetus. A fetus is no different in value than an infant. Passing such a law conveys to the public that abortion before 6-weeks is morally acceptable, and it also makes the pro-life movement look like a joke when we are celebrating a law that completely goes against our entire argument and principles.\n\nWhen you endorse gestational age bans, you are drifting further and further away from the foundation of what it means to be pro-life. You are indirectly endorsing or normalizing the killing of the unborn before a specific point, and you are making a law that has no firm basis and will inevitably be broken down by pro-aborts or used as ammunition to highlight the inconsistency of the pro-life movement. A 12-week abortion \"ban\" in the United States does not save lives. Because it's not even an actual ban, since all of the U.S. laws on the books **EXEMPT** women procuring abortions from criminal liability. There are literal websites and campaigns that allow women to order free abortion pills over the mail to take at home. And those abortion pills are things that many Republicans have supported, including Trump, Vance, and Lake.\n\nI believe gestational-age bans are ineffective, and I believe that they prevent the total abolition of abortion. In the United States, abortion is still legal in all 50 states because women are free to order abortion pills online and take them without any legal consequence. With the current laws, only abortionists can get in trouble, and some of these \"pro-life\" laws only apply a fine or a few years in prison for these mass-abortionists. How is that justice? Such laws don't really do anything because the person can just travel out of state, any woman can legally order and take an abortion pill at home up to 10 weeks of pregnancy, and it makes the pro-abortion movement empowered because we aren't being consistent. These 6-week restrictions you are talking about are not even abortion bans. They are just restrictions that slightly criminalize abortionists, but completely exempt mothers from any liability.\n\nThere is no \"age of gestation\" that we should be \"restricting\" abortion at, because there's no difference between killing an embryo vs. killing a fetus. All human beings are equal in dignity and rights, and all human beings are deserving and entitled with equal protection under the law from the moment they come into existence at fertilization.\n\n---\n\n**Do you support the death penalty?**\n\nNo. I believe capital punishment is \\[1\\] ineffective, \\[2\\] a slippery slope, \\[3\\] a bad message to the public, \\[4\\] inhumane, and \\[5\\] unjust due to the risk of innocent inmates. I believe that all humans are endowed with the right to life from the moment of fertilization until natural death.\n\n---\n\n**Is your argument based on religion?**\n\nI believe it is important and essential to make arguments against abortion that are based in science, logic, basic notions of ethics and human empathy, and reasoning. I don't think arguing off of a specific religion or specific religious text is effective or helpful.\n\nYou don't need to be a Christian or religious to be an abolitionist. **Abolitionists United** is an example of a secular abolitionist group.\n\n---\n\n**What about when the life of the mother is at risk?**\n\nIn circumstances where the mother's life is physically and imminently endangered by the pregnancy (e.g., ectopic pregnancy), I adhere to the ethical principle of **double effect**. In general philosophy, the principle of double effect tells us that if an act with good intentions will result in both good and bad results, and inaction will result entirely in bad outcome(s), then the act is justified. This principle allows for the separation of the child from the mother if it is necessary to save her life, even when the child is not developed enough to survive independently. I do not oppose such separation, provided that all medically reasonable efforts are made to save both the mother and the child. If the child is significantly younger than the age of viability (approximately 22 weeks), the child should still be treated with dignity and humanity and provided with careful perinatal palliative care if unable to survive. They should not be thrown in a medical waste bag or burnt at the hospital like most aborted babies are. I do not consider such life-saving efforts, even if the death of the child is inevitable as a result, to be abortion. The intention is not to kill the child, but to save the mother's life. If the pregnancy is not ended early in such circumstances via separation, not only will the mother die, but the baby will die as well, hence the reason for the **double** effect principle.\n\n---\n\n**How can we abolish abortion?**\n\nIn the United States, the most effective way would be to stop the incrementalistic approach, stay consistent and persistent in opposition to abortion from the moment of conception, emphasize the equal value of unborn children at all stages of pregnancy, and fight for the recognition of equal protection of the unborn by petitioning the Supreme Court to recognize that the guarantee of life by the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution applies to all humans, including the unborn.\n\nInternationally, one only needs to look to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to read that **all members of the human family are endowed with the right to life**.\n\n---\n\n**Why is incrementalism wrong?**\n\nIncrementalism for abortion is a problem because it is profoundly ineffective at making a solid moral argument, it is incapable of changing the cultural and societal views around abortion, it is inconsistent, and it is dehumanizing.\n\nIf abortion is truly murder, and if abortion is truly the #1 genocide of our time, then there is no justification for compromise or incrementalism. Nobody is going to respect or understand the anti-abortion argument if all we do is bicker over what week to ban abortion at. Abortion should not be restricted. Abortion should not be regulated. Abortion should be abolished in its entirety. And, the only way to get there is by remaining consistent in our arguments, and not making laws such as 12-week bans on abortion which send a poor message to the public that somehow killing a baby before 12-weeks is acceptable.\n\nWhether it occurs at 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 24 weeks, or right before birth, abortion is profoundly immoral and unethical, and it is no different than the murder of a newborn or toddler.", "author": "DrWavez", "time": "2024-07-15 16:38:14", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/prolife/comments/1e3zea0/i_am_an_abortion_abolitionist_ask_me_anything/", "label": "", "entities": [["Dobbs", "PERSON"], ["Jackson", "PERSON"], ["the Fourteenth Amendment", "ORG"], ["the United States Constitution", "ORG"], ["6-week", "DATE"], ["6-weeks", "DATE"], ["6-weeks", "DATE"], ["California", "GPE"], ["Texas", "GPE"], ["13-years old", "DATE"], ["13+", "DATE"], ["a few weeks", "DATE"], ["6-weeks", "DATE"], ["12-week", "DATE"], ["the United States", "GPE"], ["U.S.", "GPE"], ["Republicans", "NORP"], ["Trump", "ORG"], ["Vance", "PERSON"], ["Lake", "LOC"], ["the United States", "GPE"], ["50", "CARDINAL"], ["a few years", "DATE"], ["up to 10 weeks", "DATE"], ["6-week", "DATE"], ["\\[1\\", "ORG"], ["Christian", "NORP"], ["approximately 22 weeks", "DATE"], ["the United States", "GPE"], ["the Supreme Court", "ORG"], ["the 14th Amendment", "LAW"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", "LAW"], ["1", "MONEY"], ["what week", "DATE"], ["12-week", "DATE"], ["12-weeks", "DATE"], ["6 weeks", "DATE"], ["8 weeks", "DATE"], ["24 weeks", "DATE"]]}

{"id": "P040", "type": "post", "text": "My anti-abortion husband said if I was assaulted I would have to get one or he would abandon me and now I think he might be a moron My husband is a republican voting for Trump who for the entirety of our 7 year relationship has said he has felt he is trans his entire life but won't transition because of religious family. One of his best friends is in the lgbtq community. I think that's weird to vote the way he does when he feels like that inside, but what messed me up today is when we talked about what would happen if I was raped and became pregnant. He said he would make me get a abortion or he would leave, that he would not raise or watch me birth another man's kid. But he has also said in the past that women who get abortions for any reason deserve the death penalty. I asked him if he succeeded in voting away the rights to that abortion that he would desperately want me to get once it affects his marriage, then is all that is left is abandoning me? And he would not answer me. I just wanted him to explain to me the thought process because to me it seemed illogical and backwards. If I am assaulted and get abortion like he wants, he will believe I deserve the death penalty. If I keep the pregnancy, he will abandon me. There is no ending where I am not punished for being attacked. And while this may seem not important to some people, I was raped when I was 21 before I ever met him so it's always in the back of my mind that it has and can happen, and a topic that means alot to me. It just makes me feel very alone and confused because he is a loving husband otherwise so to have him say such heartbreaking things is just so... ugly and out of place. I feel like he has been groomed and can't see he is only parroting those that raised him because clearly his beliefs contradict each other. It makes me wonder if the gender identity he hides inside has created a form of self hatred he does not realize, or if it's just listening to the same talking points over and over has blinded him to critical thinking (we got a new car recently and now every time he picks me up from work he's listening to some radio show talking about about how joe and kamala are bad). Is anyone in relationships with partners that increasingly developed different views and how did you make it work?

Yeah, some of this might come from self-hatred but he’s choosing by himself to vote against trans rights, to turn that hatred out onto people like you.

And the Catholic Church is not hurting for wealth. If they need to support these programs, they can ask the wealthier members of their congregation to donate more to help their fellow men and women.\n\nEdit: /u/NaturalSelectorX provided better context in his reply below, as well as a link to the official statement regarding the decision. My initial point was a little undercooked and oversimplified. The core of the decision to reallocate funding is responsible budgeting, not a praise or punishment for a particular political position or ideology.\n\nProviding pregnant Pennsylvanians with greater access to well- and properly-funded family planning and abortion-related medical services is the important outcome of this decision, not whether or not it's a moral or religious issue for the government to do so.\n\nSo while the church/state element is an indirect facet of this decision, it's not the driving argument behind it as I wrote a bit too hastily above.", "author": "AzuriteKyle", "time": "2023-09-01 14:47:53", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/16777bf/after_nearly_30_years_pennsylvania_will_end_state/jyo9ui6/", "label": "", "entities": [["Pennsylvanians", "NORP"], ["the Catholic Church", "ORG"], ["Pennsylvanians", "NORP"]]}

{"id": "P010", "type": "post", "text": "AITA for exposing my husbands affair with his “girl best friend” at a family BBQ after his father told me to get over it I (29F) have been married to my husband (31M) for five years. We’ve had a good relationship overall, but there’s always been one issue: his “girl best friend,” Megan (30F). She’s been in his life since childhood, and while I’ve always felt a bit uneasy about their closeness, I trusted my husband and tried to be cool with it.\n\nMegan is always around. She’s at our house constantly, they text all the time, and she even comes on family vacations with us. Every time I brought up how their friendship made me uncomfortable, my husband would brush it off, saying she’s “practically a sister” and that I was overreacting.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, my mother-in-law (58F) is amazing. She’s always had my back and has told me multiple times that if Megan made me uncomfortable, I should talk to my husband about setting boundaries. On the other hand, my father-in-law (60M) has a very different attitude. He adores Megan and has always said that she’s part of the family and that I “just need to deal with it.” He thinks my discomfort with their friendship is just “jealousy.”\n\nFast forward to two months ago. My husband started acting distant. Coming home late, being secretive with his phone, and just… off. I had a gut feeling something was wrong, so one night, I went through his phone while he was in the shower. That’s when I found out—he and Megan had been having an affair for months. I was crushed.\n\nI confronted him, and he admitted everything. He swore it was a mistake, said he loved me, and begged me not to leave him. I didn’t know what to do, so I stayed quiet for a bit, trying to process everything.\n\nA couple of weeks later, my in-laws hosted a big family BBQ. I was still reeling from the affair, but my husband convinced me to come, saying we needed to “keep up appearances” while we worked things out. I went, but I was a wreck inside, especially knowing Megan would be there.\n\nSure enough, Megan showed up like nothing had happened, acting all friendly with everyone, including me. I was boiling inside, but I kept it together. Then, during dinner, my father-in-law made some offhand comments about how Megan would “always be part of the family” and that I needed to “get over” my insecurities. He said this in front of everyone. That was my breaking point.\n\nI stood up, looked straight at him, and said, “You know what? I would get over it if she wasn’t sleeping with my husband.” The entire table went silent. Megan’s face turned white, and my husband tried to calm me down, but I wasn’t having it. I told everyone exactly what had been going on—the sneaking around, the lies, the betrayal.\n\nMy mother-in-law was furious, but not at me. She laid into my husband and Megan, saying they’d destroyed our marriage and disrespected me. My father-in-law, though, had the audacity to say I was “overreacting” and that “affairs happen” but I shouldn’t have aired it out in front of the family. He even defended Megan, saying she made a “mistake” and we should all move on.\n\nI left the BBQ and have been staying with my mom ever since. My husband keeps begging me to come home, and my mother-in-law has been supportive, but my father-in-law is telling the whole family that I’m the one causing drama and blowing things out of proportion.\n\nAITA for exposing their affair in front of everyone at the BBQ? Should I have kept it private, or was I right to call them out after everything?\n\n{ edit based on what u guys are saying. I and MIL are very close should I show her what u guys are saying about FIL possibly cheating and see if she wants to look into that? Their marriage has been very rocky and she has been wanting to get out of it but he has been the breadwinner for years}\n\n{edit 2 there are no kids involved my soon to be ex-husband can’t have kids}\n\n{not sure if this counts as a mini-update. After seeing some of the comments about FIL maybe wanting to sleep with Megan I asked MIL if there was something weird going on there or if she knew if he’d cheated before. They have been married for a long time he’s cheated 10 times. One that u guys might find important is he slept with Megan’s mother maybe that’s why he loves her so much. As far as she knows he didn’t sleep with Megan. The other 8 were people he worked with and 1 of them was an old high school friend. I will also be researching for a lawyer tomorrow morning}\n\n{little mini update #2 MIL told FIL to get a DNA test with Megan or she’s divorcing him. He said he would try and schedule something tomorrow. I’m very glad I came to Reddit with this or some stuff we are finding out wouldn’t have come to light. If Megan is her husband's sister that would be hilarious and would be their problem. Also, MIL is getting a divorce no matter what but he doesn’t know that yet she just decided an hour ago. Yes, I will be helping her with a place to stay and she wants to get into real estate with me so I’ll be trying to pull some strings and help her out in every way I possibly can. She has seen all the comments and with Reddit and my support gave her the strength to leave. It’s a painful situation for both of us but I'm glad we are going through this together so we can have each other's support. When the DNA test results come back if it for sure happens she will be cutting off my ex-husband and FIL. I also wanted to say that FIL was sleeping with Megan’s mother for maybe a month or 2 that’s why MIL thinks the timelines add up. And yes FIL knew about the affair that boils my blood he isn’t even a decent enough human to tell me about it. If it was me or MIL cheating both FIL and ex-husband would be very pissed} I fixed my grammar for everyone angry about that.\n\nSome of you asked why he didn't just marry his best friend. At the beginning of my and my ex-husband's relationship, she was in a serious relationship. I'm assuming when he would go and comfort her after they broke up that's when it started.\n\nMy husband did try to[contact me](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/nwAy77x0i7) but I was told not to block him but it's getting hard to ignore the text.\n\n*ALL THESE UPDATES DID NOT HAPPEN IN A HOUR I POSTED THIS SOMEWHERE ELSE FIRST*\n\n[Megan contacted me](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/ZDVFLmMJ7p)\n\n{they have an appointment in an hour so the results should be back in a week or a week and a half}\n\nin the Megan screenshots, I think she meant Megan as in that's her. I said who is this before she said that as you can see. The people saying it is a lie because of that need to use their brains.\n\nI did sent Megan the screenshots of what he said waiting for a response!! It will be posted here with a link\n\n[For the people that said to send her his text](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/FThIWHkE4y)\n\nI’m grateful for all the support I have received. If I could, I would reply to all the messages and comments. I’m also very thankful for the people on TikTok who have shared my story. I’ve seen two people so far, and if you see any more, please let me know.\n\nSeveral People have asked whether they resemble each other. While there are some similarities, it's important to note that many people share features like brown hair and blue eyes, making it hard to say they look alike.\n\nI can’t provide Megan’s phone number anymore because she recently changed it. She made this decision after I shared her contact information with a few people, which led to her receiving an overwhelming amount of messages that she found annoying. I did show her the comments that people were making about her on Reddit, and it definitely affected her.\n\n{If you have a cheating spouse story you want to share join the cheating spouse community!}[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheatingspousestories/s/aCVmaaesOK](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cheatingspousestories/s/aCVmaaesOK)\n\n[In laws history](https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/s/OQnyJKnYZ0)\n\n\n[https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFXShLEq/](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZTFXShLEq/)\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/t/TFXU3t/\n\nFor those curious, we definitely don’t live in Alabama. We reside in Rhode Island.\n\n[The update](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/me8PHIdyhU)\n\nThey are half-siblings, and in the post I linked, my mother-in-law messaged me about it. I’m unsure whether I should be happy that they are siblings and are experiencing pain similar to what they put me through, or if I should be sad because I literally got cheated on with his half-sister. My FIL claims he had no idea, and my MIL is waiting for a reply from Megan’s mom. Megan is crushed that they can't get married, and my soon to be ex-husband is disgusted.\n\nAccording to Megan, they made a mutual decision to remain together despite any challenges they might face. On a different note, my ex-husband has been reaching out to me frequently, expressing his desire to rekindle our relationship and suggesting that we should get back together.\n\n\nTINY UPDATE: I recently discovered that my husband was not the only man in Megan's life. It turns out she is pregnant with another man's child. My soon-to-be ex-husband is adamant that he wants nothing to do with Megan or her baby, which complicates things even further. Now I'm faced with a difficult decision: should I inform the wife of the other man about this situation, knowing it could have serious consequences for everyone involved?\n\nI spoke to the wife about a difficult situation, where she presented an ultimatum to both Megan and her husband. She told them that Megan has to either agree to act as a surrogate and hand over the baby once it's born to the husband and his wife, or she must choose to terminate the pregnancy. If Megan doesn’t comply with either of these options, the wife indicated that she would likely leave her husband. The wife reached out to me via text to reveal that Megan is seriously contemplating the idea. My soon-to-be ex-husband is firmly set against the idea of having a child and being with Megan. She believes that if she gives up the baby, he might rekindle their relationship\n\nJust wanted to share a little update! He’s signed the divorce papers, and things are starting to fall into place. He’s stopped talking to Megan, though the ex-father-in-law still chats with her occasionally. He also signed the divorce papers with my mother-in-law. It looks like we're on the path to freedom!\n\nHello! It’s been a bit. There hasn't been much of an update regarding the divorce, but I've learned that he and Megan are no longer together. His mom mentioned that he doesn’t spend time with his father or Megan anymore.", "author": "AgencyAcademic9208", "time": "2024-10-22 14:59:48", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g9k7ib/aita_for_exposing_my_husbands_affair_with_his/", "label": "", "entities": [["AITA", "ORG"], ["BBQ", "ORG"], ["five years", "DATE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["two months ago", "DATE"], ["one night", "TIME"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["months", "DATE"], ["A couple of weeks later", "DATE"], ["BBQ", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["BBQ", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["BBQ", "ORG"], ["MIL", "PERSON"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["years", "DATE"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["n’t", "GPE"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["MIL", "PERSON"], ["10", "CARDINAL"], ["One", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["8", "CARDINAL"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["tomorrow", "DATE"], ["morning", "TIME"], ["2", "MONEY"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["tomorrow", "DATE"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["MIL", "PERSON"], ["an hour ago", "TIME"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["MIL", "PERSON"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["MIL", "PERSON"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["FIRST", "ORDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["an hour", "TIME"], ["a week or a week and a half", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["TikTok", "ORG"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["https://www.tiktok.com/t/TFXU3t/", "PERSON"], ["Alabama", "GPE"], ["Rhode Island", "GPE"], ["half", "CARDINAL"], ["FIL", "ORG"], ["MIL", "ORG"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"]]}

(Long)**\n\n**Originally posted to r/AITAH**\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!ableism, struggles with mental health, fears of physical violence!<\n\n**MOOD SPOILER:** >!Bleak, complicated!<\n\n**Thanks to u/queenlegolas & u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU**\n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/0ZifueFccS)  **Jan 21, 2025**\n\nI (28f) am getting married to my fiancé “Max” (25m) this summer. My sister, who I’ll call “Megan” (32f) has pretty serious Tourette’s. Certain physical movements and saying “Ha-ha-ha” are her most common tics but there are others as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAs long as I’ve been alive, I’ve never seen Megan sit through a long ceremony or presentation without tics, not even her highschool/college graduation or for any sibling’s graduations. Her “Ha-ha-ha” is also extremely loud, bordering on yelling, and most of the time repetitive. I have involved and invited Megan to every aspect of the wedding, (the rehearsal dinner, the bachelorette party, and the reception) except for the actual ceremony. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy fiancé and I are writing our own vows and I just want to hear him say them without interruption. The ceremony is fairly long and I seriously doubt Megan’s ability to go that long without ticcing. She has said that holding back tics is like holding back a sneeze, only a thousand times more difficult. The only options I see for her going into the ceremony are a) letting the tics go on as normal and be scrutinized by Max’s side of the family who hasn’t met her yet, or b) trying to suppress them the whole time. Either way it would be a miserable experience for her. (I have explained Megan’s situation to guests who were unaware, but in Max’s family there are several young children and elderly people that I doubt will have tact) Megan was heartbroken when I told her I didn’t want her at the ceremony. I explained my reasoning to her about how the ceremony wouldn’t be fun for her either way, but she didn’t want to hear it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe admitted that she will likely tic when we’re reading our vows, but insisted we can just pause and carry on or speak over it. I know this is selfish, but I don’t want Max to pause or speak over someone. I want him to read his vows just as he wrote them. Megan has accused me of being mean, ableist, and a “bridezilla”, my dad is on my side, my mom is on Megan’s side, and my other sister (24f) agrees with me but thinks I should let her come anyway. Max supports whatever I decide but says he hopes this doesn’t fracture our sister relationship. So, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: The kids I’m mentioning went to Max’s cousins wedding last year and were very well behaved, even though their ceremony was longer than what we’re planning ours to be, so that’s why I’m fine with them. I don’t know if this helps, but I am also autistic and have severe struggles when my routines are interrupted or when things don’t happen how I planned them. I have often been accused of being a control freak, too type A, etc. Maybe this is just me letting my controlling personality get in the way? \n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit 2: Deleted the previous edit 2, which was expressing my concern that my post would be removed for talking about violence. This is my first time using Reddit and I have tried to post to different subs where I was told even an allusion to violence would get my post taken down, and I didn’t understand the difference here. Now that I do, I’d like to clarify my biggest issue isn’t the verbal interruptions (which would greatly upset me anyway) but potential harm for Megan and other guests: \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is a nonzero chance she could injure herself or others. This is the actual crux of the issue. I could possibly, potentially handle verbal interruptions, although they would make me incredibly unhappy and uncomfortable, but I don’t think I can deal having to stop the wedding because someone has been hurt. It usually only happens in high stress situations/when she was younger, but crowds/large groups of people have historically been a trigger for her, and the ceremony would require her to stand in front of a huge crowd pretty closely to other bridesmaids. It’s happened only a few times in the past year, which should make me feel confident, but I feel like the anxiety has just been growing and growing, and I don’t know how to stop it other than making sure there is a 0% chance it could happen. Even though she said she could deal, she has a history of either underestimating or minimizing how bad her tics would be. She said she could handle her stressors and manage them but whacked me in the face at a funeral a couple years ago. She says she can handle the wedding, and I’m truly sorry if this is ableist, but I simply don’t believe or trust her anymore. She is either not being truthful with me or herself about how bad the tics can get. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry for so many edits…but I did not mean to communicate that I was ashamed of Megan or cared if Max’s family did not approve of her. If that was true, I wouldn’t have her at any parts of the wedding since those family members will also be there. Based on her previous reactions to similar situations, I assumed that kids staring would upset her, not me. Stress is a trigger for her. But people in the thread were right about how it wasn’t my place to assume and dictate how she would feel, and I messed up on that part. It’s hard to balance (reread the previous edit) when Megan does have a history of downplaying/underestimating how bad things could get. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMINOR UPDATE: I called my dad to double check, but there is a “nursery room” in the church where people can watch what’s happening in the church live on a TV inside. I hadn’t known about it because it wasn’t there when I was a kid, but it will definitely be on my list of proposed compromises when I speak with Megan. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would very much appreciate if you read the FAQs before commenting: [FAQS](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/TqAsQpkyF4) \n\n\n[FAQS on my AITA post](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/Fdqj57qKas)  **Jan 21, 2025**\n\nI’ll make this list and link it on my original post and in the comments if necessary. \n\n“Why didn’t you suggest a compromise, such as Skyping?” I genuinely did not think of them. I struggle with rigid thinking, and often categorize things as an absolute yes and no without thinking of any options in between. The suggestions for compromise have been very helpful, and I will bring them up to Megan. \n\n“How would you feel if you were disinvited because of your autism?” If the reasoning was sound, such as they believe the environment would lead me to have a meltdown, then I would understand. \n\n“What if your child has Tourette’s, how would you feel if they were excluded?” Since Tourette’s (as many of you have pointed out) is genetic, Max and I have thoroughly discussed how we would raise them. We will ALWAYS demand reasonable accommodations from school and the workplace, but we will not insist they be involved in every single activity that kids without Tourette’s can do. If we had a child that was in a wheelchair, we would not insist they be put on the track field alongside able bodied kids to see if they can wheel the 400 meter faster than they could run it. We would find an organization that caters to children in wheelchairs and specializes in helping them be active. Our hypothetical child will understand that they can’t participate in everything the other kids can, but we will always provide alternatives and they will NEVER be made to feel less than because of it.  \n\n“Why can’t you just say your vows in private?” I don’t want to. That’s literally it. I feel pretty justified in all my other plans regarding Megan, but this is simply a selfish desire rooted in nothing but Max and me’s feelings. The thought of doing vows in private makes me unhappy, the thought of doing it in front of everyone makes me happy. You can call me TA for that if you wish. \n\n“Why doesn’t your family consider that her tics particularly distress you because of your own disability (autism)?” It has never been taken very seriously by my family because it pales in comparison to Megan. If one child is drowning and the other one is just barely treading water, you go to the drowning child first. \n\n\n\n“Why are you marrying into Max’s family if they will be ableist to Megan?” They have never been ableist to Megan. When I say I worry about their behavior, I specifically mean younger children and elderly people who aren’t mentally “there” being able to stop themselves from staring. \n\n“Why do you care what Max’s family thinks?” I don’t. I don’t know how else to communicate that. It’s not THIS:\nMax’s family stares etc ➡️ I am upset\n\nIt’s THIS: \nMax’s family stares etc. ➡️ This upsets MEGAN ➡️ this stresses her and increases the likelihood of ticcing ➡️ she has a violent tic and harms herself or others \n\nThere is also selfish option b, where it causes a verbal tic and the consequence is just me being upset. \n\n“If the kids are well behaved at the other wedding you mentioned, why can’t they be told by their parents on how to behave at this one?” And now we come to the FAQ that renders the two previous ones completely irrelevant; you were right, I was wrong. I was catastrophizing (I don’t care if that’s not a word.) Several people have pointed out that beyond their parent’s ability to instruct them, they may have disabled people in their class or their lives they see often. I was projecting my own personal experiences because children rarely, if ever, don’t stare at Megan when she is ticcing. However, I honestly realized that there’s a big difference between a kid who has been prepared from conversations from their parents and know what to expect, vs kids who see some random lady yelling in the supermarket and their mom snaps at them to stop staring. In my mind, all kids were the same. \n\nI would also like to clarify that I’m upset about her verbal tics because they affect ME. I am sensitive to loud and unexpected noises, which is exactly what her tics are. Most of the time I push down my negative reactions, but if it was just us alone in the room I would STILL be distressed by her tics. \n\n“What are her violent tics?” The three main ones I know of are the elbow, stomping, and flailing her arm. Stomping and flailing her arm are just normal motor tics that people are sometimes caught in the crossfire of. With the elbow, she’s explained she MUST elbow someone or something. Most of the time it’s just the wall or whatever chair/couch she’s sitting on, but sometimes it’s a person. The elbow is also dangerous because it comes on very suddenly and is hard to hold back. The most recent elbow victim was the couch at my parent’s house, the last human victim was my dad at Thanksgiving. No offense to him but he has a decent layer of fat insulating him so he was fine. \n\nI will add more FAQs as they come\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/P9Z197C3km)  **Jan 22, 2025**\n\nUPDATE 1\n\nAdditional context I think will help:\nAll 3 girls are moved out the house. Max and I have an apartment in a big city that will remain unnamed for privacy reasons and my youngest sister (24f, I will call her Mia) is in law school at a university that will also remain unnamed. We’re both in relatively drivable distances from our hometown, where Megan and our parents live. It’s a small town where everyone knows everyone type of deal, and Megan attended a community college where she was already known by the professors and student body. While Megan lives on her own, she is very reliant on our parents. She has never even attempted to get a driver’s license because of the possibility a tic could cause her to swerve (reasonable in my opinion) so my mom drives her to and from work every day. This is not me looking down on Megan in any way for not attending a four year big name like Mia and I or for needing extra help from our parents, because she does need it. This is to explain that Megan and my parents, particularly my mom, are VERY close. In my opinion my mom does things for Megan (mostly interpersonal conflicts) that I think she can handle on her own. Megan rarely communicates directly with Mia and I, instead our mom usually calls us and says “Megan wants x” or “Megan mentioned she felt y” Our fight about the wedding was one of the few real discussions we’ve had without Mom mediating. \n\nSo the first person I actually called was my mom and not Megan. I told her that Megan and I are both grown adults who are capable of handling ourselves. I said I will not take anything into consideration other than what comes directly from Megan’s mouth. If mom tells me Megan is upset, I will disregard it. I got pretty frustrated when she steamrolled over my request and threw in her face that I’m the one paying for the wedding, not her and Dad, which I regretted. I said I’m willing to work something out with Megan, but if they refuse to communicate or try to disrupt our conversation all 3 of them will be disinvited. I reminded her Megan was an adult and hung up. \n\nI won’t copy and paste the exact text I sent Megan, but here are the main points:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n•It was not my intention to hurt you, and I’m sorry. Please let me explain \n\n\n\n•I want to TALK, not text, things are too easily misconstrued \n\n\n\n•Your verbal tics have never been a problem for me. I didn’t mean to make you feel ashamed of them.  I don’t want you to feel like we can’t talk. The wedding ceremony is a one time thing I can explain if you CALL ME.\n\n\n\n•Mom and Dad are not present in the room when she calls me. I have already called Mom and told her to stay out of my business. I want to talk to her alone, and breaking my trust on this will have serious consequences. \n\n\n\n•A list of 2 hour blocks in the next three days I’m available to have a conversation. \n\n\n\n•I love you. \n\nShe responded picking one of the times tomorrow and nothing more, but I’m hopeful we can work this out. \n\n[Update 2: Called Megan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/dpT6t6xmYG)**Jan 23, 2025**\n\n\nI called Megan this morning. I’ll summarize our conversation, excluding any verbal tics. It’s very, very, very long, and all names are fake for privacy reasons. I will refer to myself as “Michelle” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I told Megan I was sorry I hurt her feelings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Megan said it was especially mean because I know how sensitive she is about weddings & that they’re a sore spot for her \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I’m bamboozled. I inform Megan that I was NOT aware that weddings were a particularly sensitive subject for her. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* (Context: Megan & I are at the age where pretty much everyone is getting married, moreso for Megan because she lives in our small hometown. Plenty of women and one man she considers her close friends did not invite her to their wedding AT ALL.  She works at a boutique and has even encountered friends shopping for jewelry for weddings she wasn’t invited to, but I didn’t know that last part.) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Megan does not believe me. How can I not know how upsetting it is when she and my mom have repeatedly mentioned the exclusion to me every time it happens. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* My answer: Well you never told me you didn’t get invited AND you were sad about it, you just told me you weren’t getting invited.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n* Megan says it’s pretty easy to figure out and thinks I’m being purposefully obtuse. I was supposed to pick it up from context clues (the fact that she even said it, her tone when she said it, how many times she mentioned it) and apparently literally everyone else had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Megan cries. I don’t know what to do. I just wait until she stops. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I remind Megan that I struggle interpreting things like that. (This line is from Max, who I consulted, but he was not in the room.) I told her that just like she needs some accommodations for her Tourette’s, I need accommodations for my autism, and she has to explain things to me, especially feelings related things because I need that extra help.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBrief interlude you can skip if you want: \n\nMegan: “You need someone to explain crying to you?” \n\nMe: “This is the first time you’ve cried about it to me, obviously I know what crying means, I’m not a complete dumbass.” \n\nMegan: “I didn’t say you were a complete dumbass.” \n\nMe: “I felt like it was implied.” \n\nMegan: “You just told me how bad you are at understanding implications.”\n\nMe: “I can still guess.” \n\nMegan: “Well your guess is wrong.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I concede to her but repeat what I said about needing some things explained to me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* “You said we didn’t need to do that anymore”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* “Only because Aunt Marnie was such a bitch about it.” (Context: When I was 15 my dad’s sister came to live with us and help out, around this time I verbally expressed my need for clear explanations and she was so annoying. Example: She’d stop at a red light and huff, and then turn to me in backseat and say slowly, “That means I’m annoyed” like I was a toddler or something. My parents & sisters attempted with good faith and told off my aunt when she was being condescending in front of them, but they never quite caught on to what explanations I needed or didn’t need. I just got tired of correcting them and announced I was fine after about six weeks or so. (Max is very good at explicitly stating his feelings because his mom is a therapist. The whole family is very communicative and verbalize their emotions.) ) \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* “I didn’t know you were that upset about it.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I realize Megan did not know for the same reason I didn’t know weddings upset her: I never told her. Plus her tics were about at their height when this was going on, and I absolutely don’t blame her for not being observant, especially as I do not have typical tells of neurotypical people when they’re upset. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Now I explain to Megan my idea of the nursery room and live streaming it to her so she can see it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* The next accusation from Megan: “You’re ashamed of me just like (friends) are. You think I’m embarrassing.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I say no, if I was ashamed I wouldn’t invite her to anything at all. I tell her I didn’t want her at the ceremony specifically because) 1) The sudden loud noises really will distress me. Especially in a typical setup where the bridesmaids are behind me and I can’t see them, so I won’t even have a warning that it’s coming.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She says fine in a tone that I am able to pick up on, and I ask her if this is how she really feels, because if it’s not fine she needs to tell me. I haven’t even brought up the possibility of violence yet because that will make her even more upset.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* After a significant pause, she says no offense but she feels like I’m just saying this to hide that I’m ashamed of her, that her “friends” make lots of excuses like that too. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\n* I say no, but I understand why it looks that way because I have always downplayed my own issues when I’m with our family (something else Max coached me on/suggested to me). I said that if she thought I was lying she could talk to Max, his family, or any one of my friends who can verify my sensitivity to loud sound isn’t recent. \n\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She says fine in a way that I interpreted as being more mollified, and then I said I’m worried about her violent tics. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She seems more understanding but insists she can handle it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I try to gentle my voice as much as possible, but explain that anything above a zero percent chance is unacceptable for me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She says it’s not that bad, but her tone of voice and inflection is different, I interpret from this she might actually agree with me but is not ready to admit it yet, or doesn’t believe what she’s saying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I remind her that all of our family are historically bigger and that she works out a lot, (which I admire her for!) None of the family members really gets hurt when she elbows because we’re all around her size, but she has to be reminded that she’s a 5’10 muscular woman. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I reiterate this and bring up one of my bridesmaids as an example. Direct quote: “All of the other (our last name)s would be fine but Mary is 5’0 and 115 soaking wet. If you elbowed she would go the fuck down and I don’t think she would get up.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She laughs a little uncomfortably, but I’m not joking. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I remind her of Nana’s funeral where she said she would be fine and then ended up smacking me in the face. I said I know Tourette’s can be unpredictable, but she’s had 32 years to figure out her limits. I remind her that she has consistently misled me about how bad things will be. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She swears this time it will actually be fine, that she knows herself better than I do and it’s condescending to assume that she’s lying. She also reminds me Nana’s wedding was years ago, saying she’s improved, and I remind her that the last elbowing incident was months ago. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I give up at this point. I am so tired of her lying. She knows she’s lying, I know she’s lying, and she knows I know. I say fine. You can be in the ceremony if you say you can. But if you hurt someone during the ceremony you will have to leave immediately. You will be disinvited from the reception. If they sue you, I will not help financially or help you find a lawyer. And I will cut you off completely and not speak to you anymore. You will not get to meet your nieces and nephews, ever. If you’re truly willing to risk ALL that then you must be truly confident, and I trust you. Otherwise the nursery room is always open and you can watch on the TV. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She doesn’t answer me, but starts crying and says how can I do this to her, this is the only way she’ll EVER be IN a wedding in any way, no one else wants her but her own family should, it’s not fair and she just wants for one time in her life to be in a wedding. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This is a lot of information to process for me, so I just kind of pick out one piece and blurt it out before I can process the rest as whole. “Why don’t you think you’ll get married?”\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She says, are you delusional, nobody would ever want to marry me. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I know this is really insensitive, but I wasn’t trying to be mean. It was just my first reaction I didn’t think over it. I just said flatly, “Megan, you’re being really stupid.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* This seems to shock her into silence. I continued. “You’re very smart, you’re very pretty, you work out and you’re a good person. There are lots of people out there you haven’t met yet that could be a great match, maybe even someone who has Tourette’s too, so writing yourself off and preemptively giving up is incredibly dumb.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She sighs and says you don’t get it. I say yes I do, that I never thought someone would understand me until I met Max. I tell her that she’s stayed in our hometown her whole life, and there’s a reason I didn’t marry anyone from there. I did something off script, which surprised me, but I said I know she doesn’t like big crowds but she should come to (city) with me and Max or just me. I said she should try and meet new people. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She seemed taken aback and almost horrified by the thought, so I said something was probably offensive (sorry) and said “There’s an 80% chance a homeless tweaker will be doing something way more disruptive than you at any given time.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She got really quiet and didn’t say anything, so I reiterated my points: I’m not ashamed of the tics in and of themselves, I am worried about potential harm they could cause. The motor tics are self explanatory, and the vocal tics will distress me and make me uncomfortable. If she wants to bet our entire relationship on her confidence she won’t motor tic and hurt someone, she can be my guest, but I’m done. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* She starts begging me. Why can’t I get a bigger venue so the bridesmaids have more room, and place an inanimate object near in case she gets the elbowing tic? Or why did I pick so many bridesmaids when I knew she would be one and she would be crowded? Why can’t I just say my vows in private? Why can’t I just ignore her when she tics? Why, why, why. Finally, she said she felt like I didn’t take her needs into consideration and planned the wedding without thinking her at all. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I snapped. I said, “Of course I didn’t think of you, it’s MY FUCKING WEDDING. Mine! I have spent my entire life thinking of you and how things might affect you and what YOU need instead of what I do. I moved this far away so I could STOP thinking about you. You got everything. You got Mom and Dad’s attention, all the sympathy, all the money went towards your treatments. I didn’t get to see a therapist, just drive you to and from YOUR appointments. When I was nine you slammed a car door on my hand because of your tics and BROKE MY FINGER! Do you remember that? Mom and Dad were more concerned about me reassuring you I didn’t blame you than my broken bone. Everything is about you and your feelings. Oh, Megan is ticcing too much to pack her backpack, you get it Michelle. I know she threw a vase at your head during a rage fit, but Michelle, imagine how bad she feels. Megan’s sitting alone at lunch again, be a good sister and abandon YOUR FRIENDS to sit with her. And now I can’t even have my own wedding without making it about you? Fuck off.” \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Megan was silent and then hung up. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Something else that was brought up in the comments that has now been resolved: yes, Max has feelings about my family dynamic but always allowed me to dictate it, both because he knows I like control and because he doesn’t have much experience with disabilities. 95% of things, we offer feedback to the other if we think they need it, seek advice, discuss, etc. But for my family, he never really said anything except a variation of “I support your decision.” He said he would like to have input, especially as they will soon be HIS family as well and (hopefully) interacting with our future children. I can get annoyed, because his mom’s a therapist and uses “therapy speak” pretty regularly and it’s been passed on to both her kids. Secretly, I think he thinks he’s sort of an honorary therapist because he was raised by one and got treated by another. Earlier in our relationship when I was accepting his advice for family matters, he would say things like “you seem to have an avoidant attachment style, probably from being ignored by your parents in childhood.” I told him in no uncertain terms I did not care to be psychoanalyzed and that was that. We talked a lot, but the gist of it is that he has had opinions on my family, and struggles with his instinct to protect me and his desire to respect my decisions. From now on, I am going to listen to him and take his opinion into consideration when deciding about family matters. He promised to stop the “therapy talk” and says that was more him being 21 and trying to impress me with big words. I have noticed he doesn’t really do it anymore. \nSo after my call with Megan I walked into our shared bedroom, and he didn’t even have time to ask how it went before I burst into tears. He held me for a while (I am fine physical touch and affection, especially from him, as long as it’s not unexpected). Eventually my phone started ringing again and I saw that it was Mom. I told Max that I didn’t want to talk to her but if I didn’t pick up it would become a Whole Thing. He just silently held out his hand, and when I realized what he meant, I put my phone in it. The conversation wasn’t on speaker and I didn’t really care enough to try and listen to what she said and for the most part I don’t remember what he said after telling my mom I couldn’t come to the phone, just the beginning:  \n\n“Well, Michelle’s crying too. I think you should be just as concerned about that.” \n\nAnd the end: \n\n“Yeah well, my parents have said they’d more than happy to walk her down the aisle, so you think on that.” \n\nI told Max about these posts and he was a little confused but supportive, and thinks it’s funny how I’ve picked out names starting with M for everyone. I have not had any more calls from my family, but Max called his mother (very nice lady) and put her on speaker and she reiterated she’d be happy to walk me down the aisle with her husband. \n\nSo that is that for now. I find the anonymity very freeing, as well as writing down what happened, so I will update you all as soon as there is on. \n\n[An Update and goodbye](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/f8chauvcbD)  **Jan 25, 2025**\n\nMax and I have officially disinvited Megan and my parents from my wedding. I am getting lots of support and love from his family. I’ve got all the advice I feel I’ve needed, so I’m going to delete this account as it has served its purpose. I’ll leave this up for a little while before I do it so people who are invested can see it. Thanks for all the advice and help! \n\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author": "Direct-Caterpillar77", "time": "2025-02-02 05:00:01", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ifpq9c/aita_for_not_having_my_sister_with_tourettes_in/", "label": "", "entities": [["AITA", "ORG"], ["Tourette’s", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["Tourette’s", "ORG"], ["BoRU", "PERSON"], ["Jan 21, 2025", "DATE"], ["28f", "DATE"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["25", "CARDINAL"], ["this summer", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["32f", "CARDINAL"], ["Tourette", "ORG"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["only a thousand", "CARDINAL"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["AITA", "ORG"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["last year", "DATE"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["the past year", "DATE"], ["0%", "PERCENT"], ["a couple years ago", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["FAQS](https://www.reddit.com", "ORG"], ["FAQS", "ORG"], ["AITA", "ORG"], ["Jan 21, 2025", "DATE"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Tourette’s", "ORG"], ["Tourette", "ORG"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["ALWAYS", "ORG"], ["Tourette", "ORG"], ["400 meter", "QUANTITY"], ["NEVER", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["Max’s", "PERSON"], ["FAQ", "ORG"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["three", "CARDINAL"], ["Thanksgiving", "DATE"], ["Jan 22, 2025", "DATE"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["3", "CARDINAL"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["24f", "DATE"], ["Mia", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["every day", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["four year", "DATE"], ["Mia", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Mia", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Dad", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["3", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Dad", "PERSON"], ["Mom", "PERSON"], ["2 hour", "TIME"], ["the next three days", "DATE"], ["tomorrow", "DATE"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan](https://www.reddit.com/u/Kooky-Item-8576/s/dpT6t6xmYG)**Jan", "ORG"], ["23, 2025", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["this morning", "TIME"], ["Michelle” \n\n&", "WORK_OF_ART"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Tourette’s", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Aunt Marnie", "PERSON"], ["15", "CARDINAL"], ["about six weeks", "DATE"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["zero percent", "PERCENT"], ["5’10", "CARDINAL"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Mary", "PERSON"], ["5’0", "DATE"], ["115", "CARDINAL"], ["Nana", "ORG"], ["Tourette", "ORG"], ["32 years", "DATE"], ["Nana", "ORG"], ["years ago", "DATE"], ["months ago", "DATE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Tourette", "ORG"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["80%", "PERCENT"], ["MY FUCKING WEDDING.", "WORK_OF_ART"], ["Mom", "PERSON"], ["nine", "CARDINAL"], ["Dad", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Michelle", "PERSON"], ["Michelle", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["FRIENDS", "ORG"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["95%", "PERCENT"], ["21", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Mom", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Michelle", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Update", "ORG"], ["goodbye](https://www.reddit.com", "ORG"], ["Jan 25, 2025", "DATE"], ["Max", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["REPOST", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"]]}

{"id": "P022", "type": "post", "text": "AITA for Exposing My Husband’s Affair With His “Girl Best Friend” at a Family BBQ After His Dad Told Me to “Get Over It”? I (29F) have been married to my husband (31M) for five years. We’ve had a good relationship overall, but there’s always been one issue: his “girl best friend,” Megan (30F). She’s been in his life since childhood, and while I’ve always felt a bit uneasy about their closeness, I trusted my husband and tried to be cool with it.\n\nMegan is always around. She’s at our house constantly, they text all the time, and she even comes on family vacations with us. Every time I brought up how their friendship made me uncomfortable, my husband would brush it off, saying she’s “practically a sister” and that I was overreacting.\n\nTo make matters more complicated, my mother-in-law (58F) is amazing. She’s always had my back and has told me multiple times that if Megan made me uncomfortable, I should talk to my husband about setting boundaries. On the other hand, my father-in-law (60M) has a very different attitude. He adores Megan and has always said that she’s part of the family and that I “just need to deal with it.” He thinks my discomfort with their friendship is just “jealousy.”\n\nFast forward to two months ago. My husband started acting distant. Coming home late, being secretive with his phone, and just… off. I had a gut feeling something was wrong, so one night, I went through his phone while he was in the shower. That’s when I found out—he and Megan had been having an affair for months. I was crushed.\n\nI confronted him, and he admitted everything. He swore it was a mistake, said he loved me, and begged me not to leave him. I didn’t know what to do, so I stayed quiet for a bit, trying to process everything.\n\nA couple of weeks later, my in-laws hosted a big family BBQ. I was still reeling from the affair, but my husband convinced me to come, saying we needed to “keep up appearances” while we worked things out. I went, but I was a wreck inside, especially knowing Megan would be there.\n\nSure enough, Megan showed up like nothing had happened, acting all friendly with everyone, including me. I was boiling inside, but I kept it together. Then, during dinner, my father-in-law made some offhand comments about how Megan would “always be part of the family” and that I needed to “get over” my insecurities. He said this in front of everyone. That was my breaking point.\n\nI stood up, looked straight at him, and said, “You know what? I would get over it if she wasn’t sleeping with my husband.” The entire table went silent. Megan’s face turned white, and my husband tried to calm me down, but I wasn’t having it. I told everyone exactly what had been going on—the sneaking around, the lies, the betrayal.\n\nMy mother-in-law was furious, but not at me. She laid into my husband and Megan, saying they’d destroyed our marriage and disrespected me. My father-in-law, though, had the audacity to say I was “overreacting” and that “affairs happen” but I shouldn’t have aired it out in front of the family. He even defended Megan, saying she made a “mistake” and we should all move on.\n\nI left the BBQ and have been staying with my mom ever since. My husband keeps begging me to come home, and my mother-in-law has been supportive, but my father-in-law is telling the whole family that I’m the one causing drama and blowing things out of proportion.\n\nAITA for exposing their affair in front of everyone at the BBQ? Should I have kept it private, or was I right to call them out after everything?\n\n{ edit based on what u guys are saying. I and MIL are very close should I show her what u guys are saying about FIL possibly cheating and see if she wants to look into that? Their marriage has been very rocky and she has been wanting to get out of it but he has been the breadwinner for years}\n\n{edit 2 there are no kids involved my soon to be ex-husband can’t have kids}\n\n{not sure if this counts as a mini-update. After seeing some of the comments about FIL maybe wanting to sleep with Megan I asked MIL if there was something weird going on there or if she knew if he’d cheated before. They have been married for a long time he’s cheated 10 times. One that u guys might find important is he slept with Megan’s mother maybe that’s why he loves her so much. As far as she knows he didn’t sleep with Megan. The other 8 were people he worked with and 1 of them was an old high school friend. I will also be researching for a lawyer tomorrow morning}\n\n{little mini update #2 MIL told FIL to get a DNA test with Megan or she’s divorcing him. He said he would try and schedule something tomorrow. I’m very glad I came to Reddit with this or some stuff we are finding out wouldn’t have come to light. If Megan is ex husband's sister that would be hilarious and would be their problem. Also, MIL is getting a divorce no matter what but he doesn’t know that yet she just decided an hour ago. Yes, I will be helping her with a place to stay and she wants to get into real estate with me so I’ll be trying to pull some strings and help her out in every way I possibly can. She has seen all the comments and with Reddit and my support gave her the strength to leave. It’s a painful situation for both of us but I'm glad we are going through this together so we can have each other's support. When the DNA test results come back if it for sure happens she will be cutting off my ex-husband and FIL. I also wanted to say that FIL was sleeping with Megan’s mother for maybe a month or 2 that’s why MIL thinks the timelines add up. And yes FIL knew about the affair that boils my blood he isn’t even a decent enough human to tell me about it. If it was me or MIL cheating both FIL and ex-husband would be very pissed} I fixed my grammar for everyone angry about that.\n\nSome of you asked why he didn't just marry his best friend. At the beginning of me and my ex-husband's relationship, she was in a serious relationship. I'm assuming when he would go and comfort her after they broke up that's when it started.\n\nMy husband tried to [contact me](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/nwAy77x0i7)\n\n[Megan contacted me](https://www.reddit.com/u/AgencyAcademic9208/s/ZDVFLmMJ7p)\n\n{ they have an appointment in an hour so the results should be back in a week or a week and a half}\n\nin the Megan screenshots, I think she meant Megan as in that's her.

Shortly after my move he followed me, and we fell in love. We lived together from 2015 onward, and in mid-November 2018 we married. \n\nToday I discovered that virtually everything he has ever told me or demonstrated about his life was a complete fabrication. From specific medical issues to jobs (past and present) to education to family relationships to the claim that his first language was not English to phone conversations that never happened to people he knows to...if you can think it, he has lied about it. \n\nWe live together but my name is on the lease and I hold the title on both of our cars. He has some belongings in our home, but most of it has been purchased with money that I have earned over our four years together -- plus money from my personal savings account. I am totally open to letting him walk with all of 'his' stuff, and even signing the older car to him. \n\nAfter a quick internet search it looks like I might have grounds for annulment of my marriage, on the basis of being seriously misled. Do I? What will I need to be able to prove in order to make it work, and is there anything else I need to keep in mind to aim for an annulment instead of a divorce? \n\nHe is mentally ill (though quite differently than I was led to believe) and receives SSDI each month, but that is nowhere near enough for him to live on. What is the legal way to get him out of my house and life with minimal risk, damage, and cost to me? \n\nAlso, do I look for a divorce lawyer in this situation? (sorry if that's a dumb question) \n\nAlso also, how does custody of pets work? We have two kittens we got in July and I can't imagine separating them. I also can't imagine him being able to take care of them once we're separated, but I don't know if that matters. \n\n**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION** \n\n**OOP posted a comment on things her husband lied about** \n\n[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/s/HaO3okuWpV) \n\nI've had a bunch of questions about what, specifically, the man in question lied about. Here's a partial list: \n\n* that he went to school in Britain, met his (ex-)wife there, and lived there for about twenty years before returning to the US\n\n\n* that he went to the bank and tried to close out our joint account but couldn't do it because he wasn't an authorized signer on the account\n\n\n* full list of emergency medical information, including doctor's names and phone numbers, and list of medications he was (^wasn't) one\n\n\n* that his grown kids stole about $2000 from him and kicked him out of his own house\n\n\n* that he'd managed to scrape together enough money to buy a house but then his property tax increased and he ended up losing the house in an totally unfair turn of events ^turns ^out ^he'd ^so ^egregiously ^messed ^up ^his ^family's ^finances ^that ^his ^ex-wife ^ended ^up ^losing ^the ^home ^she ^grew ^up ^in\n\n\n* that his father had abused him horribly as a kid and that his mom had stood by and let it happen\n\n\n* that his aunt and uncle were the only relatives who'd really cared for him -- and his uncle had died suddenly of a heart attack (right before we really got serious) ^uncle ^is ^still ^alive ^and ^well, ^btw\n\n\n* that he'd been in Berlin when the wall came down\n\n\n* that he was harassed at the grocery store by some random lady that didn't like the way he looked\n\n\n* that he grew up speaking Polish as a first language\n\n\n* that he walked and talked in his sleep (in his first language Polish...as a side effect of the medication he was ^wasn't on\n\n\n* that his dad was a wood-worker and was making furniture for us\n\n\n* that his brother worked for DARPA\n\n\n* that his aunt was a nun\n\n\n* that a nurse at the hospital had told him some things about my dad's case that we needed to attend to\n\n\n* that he had a specific job with a host of people he worked with on a regular basis -- and all the stories he told me on a nearly daily basis about those people\n\n\n* that his boss had bought him the fancy new watch he had on his wrist\n\n\n* that Mr. Park the camera repair guy did work on his cameras for free or at a discount\n\n\n* countless lies about money spent or refunds unavailable for all kinds of reasons\n\n\n* that his counselor had actually said exactly what I just said when they'd talked about it, too! ^this ^happened ^over ^and ^over ^again\n\n\n* That he was bipolar and borderline schizophrenic (but well controlled and committed to taking his meds)\n\n\n* that he was feeling 'down' at a given time\n\n\n* that he'd posted a sign at work to collect donations for a cause I cared about, and now the only problem was finding a truck big enough to transport it all ^this ^was ^the ^lie ^that ^led ^to ^the ^end\n\n\n* that he'd met the Queen\n\n\n* that he'd been commissioned to make artwork for Harry and Megan -- and a special concierge for the Queen had come for tea to pick it up\n\n\n* that he got shot at in this bad neighbourhood this one time\n\n\n* that a candidate in a local election campaign had some specific and objectionable position\n\n\n* that he'd talked to so-and-so, and such-and-such had happened, and isn't that awesome/awful/stupid/tremendous\n\n\n* that some awful person had hit the front of our car in the parking lot and never left a note (but it's okay because he filed a report with the cops, who won't be able to do anything anyway)\n\n\n* that gallery some-name had bought his artwork. But also the payment got screwed up.\n\n\n* that his ex-wife had cheated on him continually\n\n\n* that he'd done some-activity on any-random-day\n\n\n* that he'd been asked to interview for a job at...\n\n\n* that he'd messed up his knee and went to get it fixed, but his insurance didn't cover it, so he had to pull money out to pay for it\n\n\n* that he had medical insurance\n\n\n* that he'd been on the highway in Britain and his motorcycle broke down. On his way to get help he was hit by a car, and that's how his leg got messed up.\n\n\n* that he'd looked for places to live after I was moving out but he couldn't find anything and so he needed to stay with me to avoid homelessness\n\n\n* that he needed our cats to keep him in a good mental space (see above re. mental illness lies...)\n\n\n* that he'd actually broken a rib in that car accident we'd just had, but don't worry he'd be okay\n\n\n* that some FBI agents had interviewed him because Trump\n\n\n* that he had $ pending with some lawsuits in PA but also who knows if/when that will appear because wouldn't you know it but the entire law from had been busted for I-forget-what\n\n\n* that he'd divorced his wife many years before he met me\n\n\n* that he loved me\n\n\n(Edit: fixed list formatting!) \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/s/d3NIIWWFTz)  **Feb 16, 2020 (1 year later)** \n\n[Update] Just found out husband fabricated entire life... \n\nEdit: This post got more attention than I expected, and awards I didn't even know existed (thanks, kind strangers!). A few notes for the curious among you: \n\n* for more specifics on things he lied about, [there's a partial list here](https://old.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/f4vegp/my_husbands_double_life_week_continues_with_a/fhxolm6/) \n\n* [follow this link](https://old.reddit.com/r/bestoflegaladvice/comments/f4vegp/my_husbands_double_life_week_continues_with_a/fhu3v62/) for comprehensive evidence that cats make the internet go-round \n\n* the best advice I can give for those stuck in an abusive or otherwise horrible relationship is this: (1) no matter what you think now, it will be better if you get out, (2) find people who will give you the kind of advice you'd give someone if roles were reversed, then do what they tell you that you should do, (3) when you're ready to process everything, find a therapist to help you through it, and (4) as well as you can, act in ways that will allow you to look yourself in the eye when it's over, because that will matter and also it will help you in the long run. \n\n* there's a disturbing number of people out there who have lived through things like this and much worse. Please be kind to one another, support those who need it, and refuse to tolerate poor treatment of others. \n\n*Now back to the original post...* \n\nOriginal post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/akw5d2/georgia_just_found_out_husband_fabricated_entire/). \n\nIt's been a little bit over a year since I turned to this community as my life fell rather dramatically to pieces around me. My original post didn't get a ton of attention, but the replies I received helped me tremendously, and seeing where I am a year later may also provide some hope for those going through their own crisis. In particular, you helped me construct my initial list of immediate-to-do items, and put me on the right track to figure out how to extricate myself from the relationship. \n\nThe day I first posted here was the day I found out that my then-husband had lied and fabricated most of what I knew about him. Other things I did that day included teaching a class to 200 undergrads about 15 minutes after I found out for sure, and kicking off a day-and-a-half long job interview for the next stage in my career (a job which I *somehow* landed...). \n\nWhat unfolded over the following three months can really only be described as living my way through my own version of a Lifetime movie. At some point I moved into an extended stay hotel, and as time passed I learned about the depths and breadths of the lies and deceit he'd used to both control me and get what he wanted, and the lengths he'd go to try and get his grip back on what he'd successfully manipulated his way through for about four years. What I know now -- and what I'm kind of glad I didn't really know then -- was that I wasn't actually as safe with him as I thought I was. So I'm thankful I managed to get out with only psychological/emotional/financial burden, and no physical trauma. \n\nAbout two-and-a-half months later I successfully had my marriage annulled on the basis of Fraudulent Coercion to Marry. I ended up doing the necessary research and filing the paperwork myself -- which was not an easy task, but was both cheaper and faster than it was going to be if I hired a lawyer. A few weeks after the annulment I moved my belongings out of our apartment and moved to a new city and my new job. Without him, but with the kittens. As of late June I finally had him convinced that contacting me was pointless because he wasn't getting me back, and so I've been largely free to recover from the trauma and crisis mode I lived in for about three months. \n\nOne of the things I've learned from all of this is how incredibly difficult it is to get out of a relationship in a situation like this. Besides the obvious difficulty of navigating the legal system, and the cost associated with it, there's the cognitive dissonance of constantly trying to remember to relate to that other person in light of the new information you've found out about them. It really and truly took every life skill and tremendous support of my family and friends network to get out in (more or less) one piece. And even still the road to recovery and a return to thriving is a long one. \n\nSo...thanks to those who helped me back on that terrible day in January 2019. And if you know someone who is going through something like this, please offer whatever you can in support. Because they definitely need it! \n\n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS**\n\n**OOP on how all the lies unraveled** \n\n**OOP** \n\n>His lies and fabrications started before we met, and were on a rather large scale. \n\n>Ultimately things fell apart because he made too many promises he couldn't keep. I had questions in the past, but had managed to move past them. This time it was just too much, and I asked him for evidence. I felt absolutely terrible, but I wanted a picture of something, just to allay my fears. \n\n>He provided the picture but there was a small element that didn't quite fit. Again feeling like a terrible person I did a reverse image search and discovered it wasn't his picture. \n\n>This led to more lies, as he quickly fabricated new layers to make the things I'd found out more palatable. But he took a route that meant there were questions about what was true and what he'd imagined. That led to me pulling at some threads in an attempt to help him put some pieces together (I know, right...). In the process I reached out to some people who were supposedly part of his life, and everything began to tumble in on itself. After a few days I had a more complete story and that was it. \n\n>Except...it took quite awhile to consistently remember that he was not the person I thought he was. All told I think it took about 6 months to totally come to terms with it. And even now there are occasional moments where I have to explicitly remind myself that he's not actually person A, but is actually Sir Turd Face the Undesirable.\n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author": "Direct-Caterpillar77", "time": "2024-09-18 04:02:03", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1fjk0nx/just_found_out_husband_fabricated_entire_lifecan/", "label": "", "entities": [["OOP", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["Georgia", "GPE"], ["Jan 28, 2019", "DATE"], ["four years ago", "DATE"], ["2015", "CARDINAL"], ["mid-November 2018", "DATE"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["English", "LANGUAGE"], ["four years", "DATE"], ["each month", "DATE"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["July", "DATE"], ["Britain", "GPE"], ["about twenty years", "DATE"], ["US", "GPE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["about $2000", "MONEY"], ["Berlin", "GPE"], ["Polish", "NORP"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Polish", "NORP"], ["DARPA", "ORG"], ["Park", "PERSON"], ["the Queen\n\n\n*", "WORK_OF_ART"], ["Harry", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Queen", "PERSON"], ["Britain", "GPE"], ["FBI", "ORG"], ["Trump", "PERSON"], ["many years", "DATE"], ["16, 2020", "DATE"], ["1 year later", "DATE"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["3", "CARDINAL"], ["4", "CARDINAL"], ["a year", "DATE"], ["a ton", "QUANTITY"], ["a year later", "DATE"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["that day", "DATE"], ["200", "CARDINAL"], ["about 15 minutes", "TIME"], ["day", "DATE"], ["three months", "DATE"], ["Lifetime", "PRODUCT"], ["about four years", "DATE"], ["About two", "CARDINAL"], ["Fraudulent Coercion", "ORG"], ["Marry", "PERSON"], ["A few weeks", "DATE"], ["about three months", "DATE"], ["One", "CARDINAL"], ["January 2019", "DATE"], ["a few days", "DATE"], ["about 6 months", "DATE"], ["Turd Face", "PERSON"], ["REPOST", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"]]}

OOP is u/throwraway168 and they posted to r/relationship_advice\n\n# Do NOT comment on Original Posts. See rule 7. This sub has a 7-day waiting period so the latest update is at least 7 days old.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n[I (26F) have been giving gifts to my boyfriend (29M)'s family at many celebrations, without anything in return. Do I continue?](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1gztd76/i_26f_have_been_giving_gifts_to_my_boyfriend_29ms/) November 25, 2024\n\nMy (26F) boyfriend (29M) and I have been together for 2 years. His family is very big on hosting and throwing celebrations, whereas my family tends to only do large holidays together, which will be mostly centered around food, as opposed to gifts. In the past year or so, I've been invited to his sister (28F)'s birthday, his sister's baby shower, his mom(60-somethingF)'s birthday, his sister's kid's birthday (2F), his sister's housewarming, his family's Christmas, and a couple other misc. celebrations. Every time, I bring a gift. It's to the point where I've been spending more money on gifts for his family, than my own parents and siblings.\n\nHowever, I've never gotten a gift from his family. It's not really their fault / intentional, as we will tend to do our own celebration for my birthday, so there's not really been an opportunity for his family to give me gifts (other than Christmas). But the one sided gift giving is starting to get to me.\n\nI've considered that maybe there isn't an expectation for me to bring a gift, but for most of these celebrations I'm invited to, it would be very odd not to bring one (e.g., baby shower, birthdays). I've considered doing joint gifts with my boyfriend, but his mom also pointedly asked one time, \"Is that the one from (my name)\", without me mentioning that I had even brought a gift, which made it seem like it was a given that I should have brought one.\n\nTo be clear, I don't want / need any gifts from any one in his family. I work a decently-paying job (despite being in a HCOL city), and my boyfriend and I are both more financially comfortable for our age than his family. However, the sheer number of celebrations I'm being invited to with an unspoken obligation for gifts is starting to build up, especially because it feels a little like the relationship is one sided, as I've never received anything in return. With Christmas coming up, I wonder if I should continue bringing gifts, or use this as an opportunity to work with my boyfriend and change our operating model? Or do I just bring something that's \"cheaper\", like some baked goods / chocolates/?\n\nTL;DR I have gifted my boyfriend's family (his sister, his mom, his sister's kid) gifts on \\~10 occasions this year, but haven't received anything in return. With Christmas coming up, do I use this as an opportunity to discuss with my boyfriend about how this is unsustainable, or do I just tone down the spending on my side?\n\n***Relevant Comments***:\n\n**NYCStoryteller**:\n\n>You and your boyfriend should be giving joint gifts, paid for by him, or you should stop gifting unless there's an clear expectation of reciprocity. You're not married to this guy and they're not your family.\n\n**toodrytoopoopout**:\n\n>Most definitely start bringing some baked goods. Take on a baking hobby. But not too much time investment if you’re not interested. Or want to give them that much effort.\n\n>Or even going to the store’s bakery section to get cookies and putting them on your own separate tray at home.\n\n>If they ask why the sudden switch. You can tell them, “baking from the heart is the best gift of all.”\n\n**porcelainthunders**:\n\n>That was my first thought!!\n\n>If that woman wants to ask who the gift is from you cam say \"oh. Bf (or whoever)\" and when she hints at you? Shove the tray of delicious food into your hands and say, \"I brought this...go ahead and put it out for me.\" 🤣🤭 KIDDING!\n\n>well...kidding on the last part. Just bring food. THAT is your contribution. If she ever tries to make you feel bad? Sass you? You can always go to (ok not this but a variation of?) \"I am so sorry! I thought gifts were taboo since no one ever brought any to my birthday! Oh goodness... did not realize we were still doing that for some people! I just wanted to bring something and thought this effort of taking time to make food was enough!\"\n\n>Edit typos\n\n**anitarielleliphe**:\n\n>\n\nYou state that the \"one-sided gift giving\" with your boyfriend's family is starting to get to you, but how can that be when the one-sided aspect is NOT intentional and merely a consequence of the very nature of the events that you have been invited to . . . for example . . . someone else's birthday . . . someone else's baby shower . . . someone else's house warming.\n\n>Rather than focusing on the positives . . . that you were invited . . . you are solely focused on the negatives. This is compounded by the fact that you have labeled the in-laws with negative motives and actions when you state that there is an \"unspoken obligation for gifts\" and that your boyfriend's mother \"pointedly asked one time\" about a gift she attributed to you.\n\n>First of all, unless that was the first event that you had ever been invited to, it is likely that your boyfriend's mother asked if that was the gift you were bringing because you had well established a pattern of bringing gifts.\n\n>Secondly, is your experience going to other people's baby showers, birthdays, and what-not, that you do not bring gifts and somehow this makes your boyfriend's family wrong?\n\n>You've got the following options not necessarily in order and not necessarily mutually-exclusive:\n\n>\n\n>2. Continue with doing individual gifts, but reduce the investment costs, as you suggested. If the gift is thoughtful and took time and effort, like a baked good, it will be appreciated. Again, do not worry about what others think. The old adage, \"it is the thought that counts\" applies here.\n\n>3. Change your attitude. Rather than being annoyed by being included, and annoyed that you are not receiving a gift at a baby shower, or birthday, or housewarming, when pretty much that is NOT the norm, look at it like his family thinks enough of you to include you. In reality, they are NOT obligated to include you, and rather than being skeptical that they do for the reason of a \"gift-grab,\" give them the benefit of the doubt.\n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hi95r8/update_i_26f_have_been_giving_gifts_to_my/) December 19, 2024\n\nTL;DR of my original post is that I have gifted my boyfriend's family (his sister, his mom, his sister's kid) gifts on \\~10 occasions this year (probably spent \\~$800 total), but haven't received anything in return, and was wondering if I should switch to doing joint gifts with my boyfriend.\n\nSome commenters suggested that I was not being appreciative of being invited to family events, so I thought that maybe I was being too harsh. Well, with Christmas coming up, I (26F) was invited to Christmas with my boyfriend (29M)'s family, but given his sister (28F) just had her second child with some health complications, we had a conversation and decided it made sense for me not to join them as I've been flying a lot for work and don't want to put the newborn at risk. That made the conversation about doing joint gifts super easy with my boyfriend, since I physically wouldn't be there.\n\nOut of the blue yesterday though, I received a text from my boyfriend's sister \"reminding\" me of their house address to ship gifts to (even though I've driven there multiple times). Then, about an hour later, I receive a text from my boyfriend's mother telling me about how the sister's daughter (toddler) has been a little upset recently given the new baby, and that it would be great to get the toddler an extra gift to make her feel \"special\" since the attention has been on the newborn, on top of whatever I was planning to get the newborn. She did top it off with a \"you always give such nice gifts!\" as a nice compliment.\n\nFor context, I grew up in a family that taught me not to buy gifts that you wouldn't want to receive. I bought very nice things for boyfriend's sister's kids for her daughter's birthday (toys + nice name brand clothing like Nike, Northface), and the latest baby shower for the newborn.\n\nI brought this to the attention of my boyfriend, and he mentioned he'd let them know that he was bringing our gifts, but I have a feeling they'll misinterpret to think that we're still getting separate gifts. We will see how it goes next week, but I've been super put off by the texts that I've gotten from his family - it seems pretty blatant that they want gifts from me and are expecting it, but I'm glad that my boyfriend is planning to take care of the communications...\n\n***Relevant Comments***:\n\n**Historical-Hall-2246**:\n\n>Text back, “Oh yeah! Thanks for the reminder. Here’s mine.”\n\n**LimitlessMegan**:\n\n>This is a bf problem. Just that he’s let this go on so long.\n\n>But, he doesn’t need to be telling them he’s bring the gifts. What he needs to tell them is: Here is OP’s wish list, because *I know* you didn’t just reach out to someone not coming to our celebration to ASK for gifts when you had no plans for giving her a gift **yet again** \\- and yes, I’ve noticed you haven’t once returned any of the “great gifts” she’s given you when it’s her turn to get gifts. So, I’ll be bringing try gifts from us, and will happily bring her back your gifts to her.\n\n**Material\\_Cellist4133**:\n\n>Who the hells takes gifts but doesn’t give? To the point where they call you for the gift.\n\n>Also, people saying being invited is the gift, are TAKERS. They don’t give gifts. So don’t listen to their advice.\n\n>What kind of cheap-ass family are you dealing with? You sure you want to be married into this type of family?\n\n**OOP (comment update December 26, 2024)**:\n\n>Did not expect this to have so many comments - I read through a bunch of the comments and took some inspiration from here in what I ended up doing. I'll make a longer comment / post tomorrow when I have time (as I'm still with family for xmas), but the quick update is that I did not spend any $ on gifts for his family this Christmas (but I helped BF pick some out that he bought). Boyfriend took care of most the communication, so I just texted back some pleasant \"thank you! I'll remind \\*bf name\\*! Happy Holidays!\" to his fam. Some minor drama unfolded and I'll detail tmrw, but overall I'm happy with the way BF resolved it.\n\n>To answer some of the other questions - no, I did not get Christmas gifts last year either from his fam, the excuse was that we did a late celebration on the 27th last year with his fam and so that is why they didn't give me anything (though I still brought gifts). Boyfriend didn't intervene earlier because he didn't know that they had texted me directly, and honestly he's just kind of oblivious and didn't realize how many celebrations / events we'd gone to as it's been a hectic year for both of us with work. Yes, we have a pretty high income disparity between me and BF and his family - his parents have some debt and are tight on money and his sister's husband is paying off a mortgage with expenses for two children, especially since his sister was laid off for most the year and then was pregnant / had a kid. He probably makes what his sister + sister in law made before she was laid off combined, and I make a good amount more than his sister in law too. I honestly don't need gifts from them, but it would be nice to have some reciprocation in some other way, even a thank you card or something.\n\n**InvisibleInk978**:\n\n>If their money is tight and they can’t afford gifts, how can they afford to host all these grand parties?\n\n>Do they give your boyfriend gifts?\n\n**OOP**:\n\n>Credit cards... hence the debt. Yes, they get him gifts. Nothing super expensive, but still gifts here and there\n\n>Edit: honestly, the celebrations are also a way for them to get gifts / save on certain costs. Baby shower registries, etc.\n\n#--NEW UPDATE--\n\n*Editor's Note: when an OOP updates after a BORU has been posted, we can add the new update immediately to the BORU. You STILL should not comment on the original post. Thanks to u/concaveUsurper for finding the update.*\n\n**OOP** (comment update January 3, 2025):\n\n>Now that the holidays are finally over, (and I realized that people are actually waiting for a conclusion thx to best of redditor updates) I thought I’d come here to post an update. Some new happenings unfolded through the new year that I had to deal with, hence the delay.\n\n>Pre-Christmas: I texted back to his family what I had written in the previous comment, and boyfriend called his mom and sister, which I didn’t hear the full conversation of. The message he conveyed was that we would be bringing a joint gift and listed out all the gifts I had given them this year, and pointed out that they neither wished me a happy birthday or got me a gift for Christmas last year. Apparently he was nice about it and said that he knew money was tight for them and that we’d be doing joint gift moving forwards so they wouldn’t have to worry about a return gift (this is a very fine arrangement with me). \nHe hates shopping anyways, so he gave me a budget for each of his family members and I chose the gifts for him. He didn’t mention to his family I hadn’t pitched in any money. \n\n>Christmas: I had a lovely Christmas with my family, but boyfriend calls me at noon. He tells me to ignore any texts I might get from his family and that he will explain when we are together. I don’t get anything from them until the evening - a text from his mom that just says “*bf name* will bring back presents from us to you. It would be great if you could come celebrate NYE with us as the baby is in stable condition, and we will celebrate the baby’s recovery. No need to bring anything for us, just the baby” I forwarded the message to BF. Apparently his family had bought me literal dollar store gifts in an attempt for us to keep doing separate gifts that he was refusing to bring back to me. They wanted to do another celebration on NYE for more gifts for the baby. BF told me he had already told them we weren’t going. It overall was just minor drama because I never had to talk to anyone from his family, he handled it all. He told them that if they were going to treat me like that, we would no longer be joining their celebrations. \n\n>Day after Christmas: my boyfriend came over to visit my family for Christmas, my parents still got him a gift. He immediately felt really bad and we spent most the day together with my family + planning a NYE/NY date night between the two of us. It was exciting. I thought that was the end of it. \n\n>before New Year’s: boyfriend’s mom calls him while he’s at my place and basically starts breaking down. She says that boyfriend and I make more than his family (mom, dad, sister, brother in law) combined and apparently the debt of his parents and sister are much larger sums than he had assumed. Apparently they *really appreciated* my gifts because it felt like a little bit of *luxury* in what felt like a life of “despair” given their snowballing debt. They had too much pride to say anything and basically ended up bullying me about it (boyfriends words) instead to get things they wanted. apparently he texted his mom about the gift my parents got him and it made her feel like she was going to lose him to me / my family because of money. Boyfriend told her that it wasn’t about money - it was about treating people with basic decency. They talked a looooot more but the tl;dr is that his fam has been under a lot of financial stress and pressure, much much more than we had thought, and was a bit spiteful of how much money we earn, and wants help. \n\n>I reflected on all the comments saying I was being a door mat, and I think my stance on this is that I knew I didn’t need gifts from them - I just wanted a little more appreciation. So I was in a little bit of a pickle about what to do - because I genuinely enjoyed gifting and picking out gifts, but also felt like I was being used. I just wanted them to appreciate the gifts. Maybe that’s petty (saw a comment saying you should never expect anything in return when gifting). To those saying BF is a problem, I think this might be a relatively new thing with his family that he’s just now recognizing. Debt accumulation is recent, past 2 yrs after his sister had her first kid. He’s handled it gracefully as it unraveled. \n\n>We spent NYE and NY with just the two of us. It was lovely. We don’t have a resolution on how we will deal with his family yet. He holds strong boundaries and won’t be giving them any money, but will continue to bring gifts to celebrations his family hosts (if he’s still invited lol)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n# Reminder: I am not OOP.

{"id": "P049", "type": "post", "text": "WIBITA for not wanting to participate in my family’s \"one gift swap\" Christmas idea? (New Update) **I am not The OOP, OOP is u/PurpleWo1** \n\n**WIBITA for not wanting to participate in my family’s \"one gift swap\" Christmas idea?** \n\n**Originally posted to r/AITAH** \n\n**Thanks to u/soayherder for suggesting this BoRU** \n\n[BoRU 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/s/7bBjbugGVm)\n\n**TRIGGER WARNING:** >!controlling behavior, PTSD, favoritism!< \n\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/g4yISznx3g)  **Nov 2, 2024** \n\nSo, last night, I (22M) went with my mom to visit my brother, Leaf (27M), at his apartment. My other brother, Dax (24M), was also there. We were hanging out, eating, and just catching up since it's rare we’re all free at the same time. \n\nChristmas is going to be weird this year because for the first time, we’re not all spending it together. Dax is spending the holiday with his in-laws, wife, and kids, and Leaf is doing the same. I’ll be with my mom, stepdad, my partner, and grandma. We’re planning to get together sometime after Christmas so we can all see each other, but it’s not the same. \n\nAnyway, while we were talking, Dax brought up an idea he’s really excited about: he wants us all to spend $50 on a single gift, wrap it in neutral wrapping paper, and then do a gift swap. The way it works is the first person picks a gift, and each person after can either pick a new gift or “steal” an opened one. At the end, the first person gets one last chance to swap with anyone if they want. \n\nThe thing is... I really don’t want to do this. To me, Christmas isn’t about receiving gifts; it’s about giving them. I love spending time picking out something thoughtful for each person, something I think will genuinely make them happy. Seeing their reactions means a lot to me. This “one gift swap” thing just feels too impersonal and, honestly, kind of corporate. \n\nAnd before anyone asks, no, my brother isn’t tight on money. He's actually pretty well-off, much more than me, but that’s not the point. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told my brother I’d rather not participate in his gift swap idea? I’d still love to give everyone personal gifts, but I just don’t want to do this impersonal gift exchange. It just doesn’t feel right to me. \n\n  \n\\- \n\nEDIT\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\nWow, I wasn’t expecting so many replies, and I can’t respond to everyone, so I thought it would be best to put this all in an edit. Anyway, everyone in my family is pretty well off, including all of Dax's in-laws, Leaf and his in-laws, etc. Leaf and his wife aren’t really into the idea of doing White Elephant this year, and neither are my mom or stepdad. We all know how complicated Christmas gets as the family grows, and we’d honestly prefer to do Secret Santa instead. \n\nAlso, just for context, Dax’s mother-in-law is outright refusing to participate in White Elephant and is insisting on an expensive gift instead. If she doesn’t get one, she won’t come to their Christmas celebration, which is just adding to the drama. My brother Dax can be very controlling, and most of the time we just let him have his way because it’s easier than dealing with the tension if he doesn’t. He tends to make everyone uncomfortable if things aren’t exactly how he wants them. \n\nMy mom also isn’t thrilled about doing White Elephant because of what happened last year. She and my grandma booked a holiday home in Salem for Christmas, with my mom covering about 90% of the cost and my grandma pitching in around 10%. But then my brothers ended up getting our grandma a gift to thank her while giving nothing to our mom, who had covered most of the expenses. To make it worse, Dax and Leaf both got their mothers-in-law expensive gifts, but didn’t even think to give our mom something small. My mom isn’t materialistic at all; she’d be happy with just a thank-you card. But that’s part of why she’s not on board with White Elephant this year. \n\nFor me, I’d rather skip getting a gift altogether than end up with something I don’t want. So, this year, I’ve decided to focus on gifts for my partner (it’s her second Christmas with us, and her family doesn’t celebrate), as well as gifts for my mom, stepdad, grandma, and all the nieces and nephews. \n\nAt the end of the day, we just want to find a middle ground that works for everyone. We’re hoping Dax can feel satisfied too, but we’ll see. I’ll keep you updated on any compromises or what ends up happening in December. \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/BzbkuxtSxU)  **Nov 27, 2024** \n\nSo, I posted here a while back about this ([WIBTA for not wanting to do my family’s “one gift swap” Christmas idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ght0tx/wibita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my/)). Well, buckle up because here’s the update. - You can find the original on my page. \n\n# TL;DR Recap: \n\nMy brother Dax (24M) suggested doing *white elephant* for Christmas instead of exchanging individual gifts. This idea was... not well-received. I (22M) am in a family group chat with Dax, my other brother Leaf (27M), their wives Megan (29F) and Blaire (27F), our mom (61F), stepdad (60M), grandma (79F), stepsisters Edie (22F) and Tatum (19F), and my partner Maeve (23F)—who isn’t in the chat but is VERY relevant here. Dax announced his idea like a dictator issuing a decree, not like, “Hey, thoughts?” \n\nLet’s just say... the family vibes have been shaken. \n\n# What Went Down: \n\nA few days ago, Grandma told us Dax had something “important” to share. Turns out, it was him rehashing the white elephant plan, complete with rules. And not like, “What do you guys think?”—more like “This is what we’re doing, no discussion.” \n\nHere’s the thing about Dax: he’s a control freak. Last year, he strong-armed us into Secret Santa, which most of us hated but didn’t challenge because... you don’t mess with Dax. This year, I decided to grow a spine and said, “Hey, this isn’t fun for most of us. White elephant feels corporate and joyless—it’s not what Christmas means to *our* family.” I even suggested sticking to Secret Santa if the issue is cost. \n\nApparently, this was *blasphemy*. \n\n# The Fallout: \n\nNot long after, Mom called me in tears. She admitted the white elephant idea made her feel awful. She said it hurts that her sons don’t want to buy her a Christmas gift anymore, especially when she does so much for everyone. She then went *full mom mode* in the group chat: \n\n1. She said she doesn’t like the white elephant idea because she loves personal gift-giving.\n2. She *directly asked Megan and Blaire* if they planned to skip individual gifts for their own families too. \n\nBoth Megan and Blaire said, “Oh no, we’ll still get individual gifts for *our* families!” Cue Mom’s second call to me—*angrier* and sadder. She feels like she’s being treated as a second-class family member by her sons, who’ll put effort into gifts for their in-laws but can’t be bothered for her. (And honestly? She has a point. My brothers either buy her last-minute junk or forget entirely.) \n\n# Maeve and the Stepsisters Join the Rebellion: \n\nI called Maeve to vent, and she was fuming. She’s been budgeting over $300 to get thoughtful gifts for everyone (first Christmas with my family, wants to make a good impression). She said if it’s going to be white elephant, it’s a waste—her gifts won’t even go to the right people. \n\nMeanwhile, my stepsisters Edie and Tatum jumped in to say they *also* hate the white elephant idea. Edie even called it “lazy” on Dax’s part. (Hero.) Dax, feeling the heat, proposed a vote: White elephant or Secret Santa. By this point, though, I was *done*. I dropped out entirely, and so did Edie, Tatum, Maeve, Mom, Stepdad, and Grandma. \n\n# Enter Blaire, the Plot Twist Queen: \n\nBlaire suddenly chimed in with a new idea: “Since so many people are dropping out, let’s just do gifts for the kids.” She framed it like a compromise, but really, it was her way of shutting down the adults entirely. Dax, Leaf, and Megan jumped on board, and Dax declared, “Christmas is only for kids.” \n\nOkay, sure, Dax. 🙄 \n\n# Where Things Stand: \n\nSo now? It’s chaos. Mom, Maeve, Edie, Tatum, and I have decided we’ll exchange gifts *with each other*. We’re still getting presents for the kids because they’re innocent in all this, but Dax, Leaf, Megan, and Blaire? They’re getting *nothing* from us. \n\nChristmas plans are totally up in the air, and honestly, this whole thing has killed the holiday vibe for me. It’s a mess, and while it’s not the resolution I wanted, at least I know who’s on Team Christmas Spirit. \n\n# Final Thoughts: \n\nIf Christmas is “just for kids” now, then Dax, Leaf, Megan, and Blaire can go be kids together. Meanwhile, I’ll be over here with my mom, stepsisters, and Maeve, celebrating with love, laughter, and thoughtful gifts— \n\nSo yeah. Not the *happy* update, but there it is. \n\nThoughts? Am I still the a-hole? (Also, any tips for surviving awkward family Christmas dinners would be much appreciated…) 🎄 \n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/SWzQa1BRf9)  **Nov 28, 2024** \n\nHoly freakin’ shit… my brother might be in debt… \n\nI’m at work right now, so sorry for any grammar mistakes. I’m literally typing this on my phone while heading back to my desk. But yeah... \n\nSo yeah, Dax finally came clean to my mom about why he’s been pushing the whole secret Santa thing last year and this white elephant deal this year. Turns out, he’s drowning in debt. \n\nApparently, Dax and his wife Megan have been spending like they’re loaded—fancy vacations, high-end crap, you name it. They’ve almost maxed out their credit cards trying to live like they’re in a *Real Housewives* episode. Now they’re up to their eyeballs in debt. \n\nDax admitted to my mom that he’s dealing with some heavy PTSD and said he’s going to start therapy because he’s lost and doesn’t know what to do. My mom told him straight up: he’s gotta quit blowing money like this and walk away from this stupid deal on the new house they’re trying to buy. \n\nBut Dax being Dax…he’s not listening. He’s terrified his friends and co-workers are gonna judge him if he doesn’t keep up this whole “rich guy” act. Like, dude, nobody cares as much as you think they do. Egos are wild, huh? \n\nLook, I feel bad for my brother, I really do. But at the same time, how do you spend money like it’s Monopoly cash and not think it’s gonna catch up to you? Still, I wish I could help him. I can’t help financially—I don’t make much—but I can at least help him and Megan with the kids so they can maybe figure this mess out. \n\nAs for Christmas, I *tried* to be petty. I thought about only buying gifts for the family members not doing this white elephant nonsense, plus my nieces and nephews. But my guilt kicked in, so I ended up getting something for Dax, Megan, Leaf, and Blaire too. I know they’re probably not gonna get me anything, but whatever. Christmas isn’t about presents anyway. \n\nI just hope Dax wakes up from this and learns to stop spending money he doesn’t have. But I can’t say that to him, you know? Younger brother and all that. \n\nAnyway, holy shit. If there’s another update, I’ll post. Hope you guys have a good holiday. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**Con4America** \n\n>YTA  No gifts for anyone would have been better.  You are just enabling the tow of them. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>You can see it that way, but like I said, I don’t care if I get gifts or not. I just like giving personal gifts. I love buying things for people because gift-giving is my love language. The whole point of my original post was that I was upset my brother was taking away my choice to buy gifts for people and trying to dictate what everyone else does. I didn’t want to do a white elephant exchange because I don’t like buying generic gifts. I want to get each person something I know they’ll like—not something that’ll just sit on a shelf collecting dust or get re-gifted to someone else. Like I said, I love buying gifts for people. I’m not in it for what I get in return. \n\n>>P.S I’m going to do everything I can to help my brother and his family.

I’ve always been the kind of person who wants to take on everyone’s problems, figure out what’s bothering them, and fix it. I’m a fixer, that’s just how I am. I worry about Dax. We don’t have the best relationship, and we didn’t really talk much after he moved out seven years ago. But whenever he’s had trouble, I’ve done what I could to help. \n\n>>>>I’m worried he might start drinking again because of the stress and depression. He’s been sober for two years now, and I’m really proud of him for that. But I don’t know what to do. Part of me thinks I should step back and let him handle this himself since he’s the one who got himself into this mess. But another part of me just wants to fix it all, figure it out, and make everything okay. Honestly, I feel like crying because I feel so bad for my brother. I don’t want to enable him, but I also don’t want him to suffer. Nothing about this is black and white—it’s all shades of gray. \n\n[Final update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/sSRWT3aIjA)  **Nov 29, 2024** \n\nThis will be my final update on this post, and honestly, probably my last post on Reddit for a while. I’m planning to sign out and focus on dealing with everything going on. \n\nIt’s super late here, and I just got back from seeing my mom. Apparently, someone sent her the post, and she told me she was disappointed—not in a harsh way, but because I’ve been carrying the weight of trying to fix my brother Dax’s issues all on my own. I don’t know why, but hearing her say it made something in me finally break. I realized I’ve been struggling so much internally without even noticing. \n\nMy mom said she could tell something was wrong because I’ve stopped eating properly and, in her words, “look like a Victorian child.” \n\nI didn’t fully realize how much stress I’ve been carrying until now. She reminded me that it’s not my job to take on all of this. She also said that Dax, as stubborn and impulsive as he is, will figure out his own mess in time. \n\nOn top of that, my mom’s been talking to Dax directly about everything. She suggested that he and his partner consider backing out of the house deal and looking for somewhere cheaper. She reassured him that no one would think any less of him for doing so. \n\nAs for the Christmas situation, we’ve decided to cancel the gift swaps with the original group that wanted to do the White Elephant exchange. I’m planning to save the gifts I had for them and give them out on their birthdays instead. \n\nI’ve also made a big decision to step back from my family for a while and focus on moving forward with my plans to relocate my job to Zurich. I care about Dax and always will, but I need to start being less “selfless” and more “selfish” about my own life. \n\nDax is smart. He’ll figure things out. I’ll be there to support him emotionally and morally, but I’ve decided I can’t support him financially anymore. \n\nThanks to everyone who’s followed along and offered advice. I’ve made another big decision to check myself into therapy to address the depression and mental health struggles I’ve been ignoring for years. It’s time to stop pushing that aside and finally deal with it. \n\nTake care, everyone. \n\n##**NEW UPDATE**\n*\n\n[White Elephant Update + Holiday Chaos & Personal Struggles (Last Update)](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/xjI9Q1dqQd)  **Jan 20, 2025**\n\nYou can read everything on this link (it includes the original updates): https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h2h15e/comment/m62rdt9/?context=3\n\nSo, I think people have been wanting updates on the White Elephant situation. We all met up on December 26th, and Dax actually got us a gift, but it wasn’t individual gifts. It was a *household* gift—portraits of their kids. It was cute, though, and I’ll be taking them to Switzerland with me! Leaf also got me a small ornament with my name on it, which is now proudly displayed in my box.\n\nBut wow, that day was chaotic. I got hit in the back of the head by one of those little plastic balls from a kids' golf set. It hurt a bit, and I was lowkey worried that something in my parents’ house would get broken. My parents weren’t too pleased that Dax and Leaf let their kids run around with outside toys inside, but they didn’t want to make a big deal of it—plus they were super busy preparing dinner.\n\nOh, and my partner and I had a lot of arguments that holiday too. She wants me to move to Switzerland earlier, but I’ve been dealing with some finance issues, and on top of that, I lost my job. So yeah, the move to Switzerland has been delayed.\n\nOn a more personal note, I’ve been struggling a lot with depression and anxiety lately, but I’m trying to stay positive. I don’t want to spiral back into those negative thoughts, so I’m doing my best to keep my head above water.\n\nAnyway, that’s the update! I’ve been a bit all over the place, but here’s to hoping things start to settle down soon.\n\nOh yeah, I was also diagnosed with autism too - so yeah \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author": "Direct-Caterpillar77", "time": "2025-01-27 05:04:02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1ib0f0x/wibita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my/", "label": "", "entities": [["WIBITA", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["New Update", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["BoRU", "PERSON"], ["BoRU", "PERSON"], ["Nov 2, 2024", "DATE"], ["last night", "TIME"], ["22", "CARDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["50", "MONEY"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["WIBTA", "ORG"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["last year", "DATE"], ["Salem", "GPE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["about 90%", "PERCENT"], ["around 10%", "PERCENT"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["the end of the day", "DATE"], ["December", "DATE"], ["Nov 27, 2024** \n\nSo", "DATE"], ["WIBTA", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["22", "CARDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["27F", "CARDINAL"], ["79F", "CARDINAL"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["22F", "CARDINAL"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["23F)—who", "CARDINAL"], ["A few days ago", "DATE"], ["Grandma", "PERSON"], ["Last year", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "GPE"], ["This year", "DATE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["Mom", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan and Blaire", "ORG"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["last-minute", "TIME"], ["Maeve", "PERSON"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["over $300", "MONEY"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Maeve", "GPE"], ["Mom", "GPE"], ["Stepdad", "PERSON"], ["Grandma", "PERSON"], ["Enter Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Team Christmas Spirit", "FAC"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Nov 28, 2024** \n\nHoly freakin", "DATE"], ["Santa", "GPE"], ["last year", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["seven years ago", "DATE"], ["two years", "DATE"], ["Nov 29, 2024", "DATE"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Victorian", "NORP"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["the White Elephant", "ORG"], ["Zurich", "GPE"], ["years", "DATE"], ["#", "MONEY"], ["White Elephant Update + Holiday Chaos & Personal Struggles", "ORG"], ["Jan 20, 2025", "DATE"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["December 26th", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Switzerland", "GPE"], ["that day", "DATE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Switzerland", "GPE"], ["Switzerland", "GPE"], ["REPOST", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"]]}

My other brother, Dax (24M), was also there. We were hanging out, eating, and just catching up since it's rare we’re all free at the same time. \n\nChristmas is going to be weird this year because for the first time, we’re not all spending it together. Dax is spending the holiday with his in-laws, wife, and kids, and Leaf is doing the same. I’ll be with my mom, stepdad, my partner, and grandma. We’re planning to get together sometime after Christmas so we can all see each other, but it’s not the same. \n\nAnyway, while we were talking, Dax brought up an idea he’s really excited about: he wants us all to spend $50 on a single gift, wrap it in neutral wrapping paper, and then do a gift swap. The way it works is the first person picks a gift, and each person after can either pick a new gift or “steal” an opened one. At the end, the first person gets one last chance to swap with anyone if they want. \n\nThe thing is... I really don’t want to do this. To me, Christmas isn’t about receiving gifts; it’s about giving them. I love spending time picking out something thoughtful for each person, something I think will genuinely make them happy. Seeing their reactions means a lot to me. This “one gift swap” thing just feels too impersonal and, honestly, kind of corporate. \n\nAnd before anyone asks, no, my brother isn’t tight on money. He's actually pretty well-off, much more than me, but that’s not the point. \n\nSo, WIBTA if I told my brother I’d rather not participate in his gift swap idea? I’d still love to give everyone personal gifts, but I just don’t want to do this impersonal gift exchange. It just doesn’t feel right to me. \n\n  \n\\- \n\nEDIT\\*\\*\\*\\* \n\nWow, I wasn’t expecting so many replies, and I can’t respond to everyone, so I thought it would be best to put this all in an edit. Anyway, everyone in my family is pretty well off, including all of Dax's in-laws, Leaf and his in-laws, etc. Leaf and his wife aren’t really into the idea of doing White Elephant this year, and neither are my mom or stepdad. We all know how complicated Christmas gets as the family grows, and we’d honestly prefer to do Secret Santa instead. \n\nAlso, just for context, Dax’s mother-in-law is outright refusing to participate in White Elephant and is insisting on an expensive gift instead. If she doesn’t get one, she won’t come to their Christmas celebration, which is just adding to the drama. My brother Dax can be very controlling, and most of the time we just let him have his way because it’s easier than dealing with the tension if he doesn’t. He tends to make everyone uncomfortable if things aren’t exactly how he wants them. \n\nMy mom also isn’t thrilled about doing White Elephant because of what happened last year. She and my grandma booked a holiday home in Salem for Christmas, with my mom covering about 90% of the cost and my grandma pitching in around 10%. But then my brothers ended up getting our grandma a gift to thank her while giving nothing to our mom, who had covered most of the expenses. To make it worse, Dax and Leaf both got their mothers-in-law expensive gifts, but didn’t even think to give our mom something small. My mom isn’t materialistic at all; she’d be happy with just a thank-you card. But that’s part of why she’s not on board with White Elephant this year. \n\nFor me, I’d rather skip getting a gift altogether than end up with something I don’t want. So, this year, I’ve decided to focus on gifts for my partner (it’s her second Christmas with us, and her family doesn’t celebrate), as well as gifts for my mom, stepdad, grandma, and all the nieces and nephews. \n\nAt the end of the day, we just want to find a middle ground that works for everyone. We’re hoping Dax can feel satisfied too, but we’ll see. I’ll keep you updated on any compromises or what ends up happening in December. \n\n[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/BzbkuxtSxU)  **Nov 27, 2024** \n\nSo, I posted here a while back about this ([WIBTA for not wanting to do my family’s “one gift swap” Christmas idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ght0tx/wibita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my/)). Well, buckle up because here’s the update. - You can find the original on my page. \n\n# TL;DR Recap: \n\nMy brother Dax (24M) suggested doing *white elephant* for Christmas instead of exchanging individual gifts. This idea was... not well-received. I (22M) am in a family group chat with Dax, my other brother Leaf (27M), their wives Megan (29F) and Blaire (27F), our mom (61F), stepdad (60M), grandma (79F), stepsisters Edie (22F) and Tatum (19F), and my partner Maeve (23F)—who isn’t in the chat but is VERY relevant here. Dax announced his idea like a dictator issuing a decree, not like, “Hey, thoughts?” \n\nLet’s just say... the family vibes have been shaken. \n\n# What Went Down: \n\nA few days ago, Grandma told us Dax had something “important” to share. Turns out, it was him rehashing the white elephant plan, complete with rules. And not like, “What do you guys think?”—more like “This is what we’re doing, no discussion.” \n\nHere’s the thing about Dax: he’s a control freak. Last year, he strong-armed us into Secret Santa, which most of us hated but didn’t challenge because... you don’t mess with Dax. This year, I decided to grow a spine and said, “Hey, this isn’t fun for most of us. White elephant feels corporate and joyless—it’s not what Christmas means to *our* family.” I even suggested sticking to Secret Santa if the issue is cost. \n\nApparently, this was *blasphemy*. \n\n# The Fallout: \n\nNot long after, Mom called me in tears. She admitted the white elephant idea made her feel awful. She said it hurts that her sons don’t want to buy her a Christmas gift anymore, especially when she does so much for everyone. She then went *full mom mode* in the group chat: \n\n1. She said she doesn’t like the white elephant idea because she loves personal gift-giving.\n2. She *directly asked Megan and Blaire* if they planned to skip individual gifts for their own families too. \n\nBoth Megan and Blaire said, “Oh no, we’ll still get individual gifts for *our* families!” Cue Mom’s second call to me—*angrier* and sadder. She feels like she’s being treated as a second-class family member by her sons, who’ll put effort into gifts for their in-laws but can’t be bothered for her. (And honestly? She has a point. My brothers either buy her last-minute junk or forget entirely.) \n\n# Maeve and the Stepsisters Join the Rebellion: \n\nI called Maeve to vent, and she was fuming. She’s been budgeting over $300 to get thoughtful gifts for everyone (first Christmas with my family, wants to make a good impression). She said if it’s going to be white elephant, it’s a waste—her gifts won’t even go to the right people. \n\nMeanwhile, my stepsisters Edie and Tatum jumped in to say they *also* hate the white elephant idea. Edie even called it “lazy” on Dax’s part. (Hero.) Dax, feeling the heat, proposed a vote: White elephant or Secret Santa. By this point, though, I was *done*. I dropped out entirely, and so did Edie, Tatum, Maeve, Mom, Stepdad, and Grandma. \n\n# Enter Blaire, the Plot Twist Queen: \n\nBlaire suddenly chimed in with a new idea: “Since so many people are dropping out, let’s just do gifts for the kids.” She framed it like a compromise, but really, it was her way of shutting down the adults entirely. Dax, Leaf, and Megan jumped on board, and Dax declared, “Christmas is only for kids.” \n\nOkay, sure, Dax. 🙄 \n\n# Where Things Stand: \n\nSo now? It’s chaos. Mom, Maeve, Edie, Tatum, and I have decided we’ll exchange gifts *with each other*. We’re still getting presents for the kids because they’re innocent in all this, but Dax, Leaf, Megan, and Blaire? They’re getting *nothing* from us. \n\nChristmas plans are totally up in the air, and honestly, this whole thing has killed the holiday vibe for me. It’s a mess, and while it’s not the resolution I wanted, at least I know who’s on Team Christmas Spirit. \n\n# Final Thoughts: \n\nIf Christmas is “just for kids” now, then Dax, Leaf, Megan, and Blaire can go be kids together. Meanwhile, I’ll be over here with my mom, stepsisters, and Maeve, celebrating with love, laughter, and thoughtful gifts— \n\nSo yeah. Not the *happy* update, but there it is. \n\nThoughts? Am I still the a-hole? (Also, any tips for surviving awkward family Christmas dinners would be much appreciated…) 🎄 \n\n[Update 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/SWzQa1BRf9)  **Nov 28, 2024** \n\nHoly freakin’ shit… my brother might be in debt… \n\nI’m at work right now, so sorry for any grammar mistakes. I’m literally typing this on my phone while heading back to my desk. But yeah... \n\nSo yeah, Dax finally came clean to my mom about why he’s been pushing the whole secret Santa thing last year and this white elephant deal this year. Turns out, he’s drowning in debt. \n\nApparently, Dax and his wife Megan have been spending like they’re loaded—fancy vacations, high-end crap, you name it. They’ve almost maxed out their credit cards trying to live like they’re in a *Real Housewives* episode. Now they’re up to their eyeballs in debt. \n\nDax admitted to my mom that he’s dealing with some heavy PTSD and said he’s going to start therapy because he’s lost and doesn’t know what to do. My mom told him straight up: he’s gotta quit blowing money like this and walk away from this stupid deal on the new house they’re trying to buy. \n\nBut Dax being Dax…he’s not listening. He’s terrified his friends and co-workers are gonna judge him if he doesn’t keep up this whole “rich guy” act. Like, dude, nobody cares as much as you think they do. Egos are wild, huh? \n\nLook, I feel bad for my brother, I really do. But at the same time, how do you spend money like it’s Monopoly cash and not think it’s gonna catch up to you? Still, I wish I could help him. I can’t help financially—I don’t make much—but I can at least help him and Megan with the kids so they can maybe figure this mess out. \n\nAs for Christmas, I *tried* to be petty. I thought about only buying gifts for the family members not doing this white elephant nonsense, plus my nieces and nephews. But my guilt kicked in, so I ended up getting something for Dax, Megan, Leaf, and Blaire too. I know they’re probably not gonna get me anything, but whatever. Christmas isn’t about presents anyway. \n\nI just hope Dax wakes up from this and learns to stop spending money he doesn’t have. But I can’t say that to him, you know? Younger brother and all that. \n\nAnyway, holy shit. If there’s another update, I’ll post. Hope you guys have a good holiday. \n\n**RELEVANT COMMENTS** \n\n**Con4America** \n\n>YTA  No gifts for anyone would have been better.  You are just enabling the tow of them. \n\n**OOP** \n\n>>You can see it that way, but like I said, I don’t care if I get gifts or not.

Nothing about this is black and white—it’s all shades of gray. \n\n[Final update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/sSRWT3aIjA)  **Nov 29, 2024** \n\nThis will be my final update on this post, and honestly, probably my last post on Reddit for a while. I’m planning to sign out and focus on dealing with everything going on. \n\nIt’s super late here, and I just got back from seeing my mom. Apparently, someone sent her the post, and she told me she was disappointed—not in a harsh way, but because I’ve been carrying the weight of trying to fix my brother Dax’s issues all on my own. I don’t know why, but hearing her say it made something in me finally break. I realized I’ve been struggling so much internally without even noticing. \n\nMy mom said she could tell something was wrong because I’ve stopped eating properly and, in her words, “look like a Victorian child.” \n\nI didn’t fully realize how much stress I’ve been carrying until now. She reminded me that it’s not my job to take on all of this. She also said that Dax, as stubborn and impulsive as he is, will figure out his own mess in time. \n\nOn top of that, my mom’s been talking to Dax directly about everything. She suggested that he and his partner consider backing out of the house deal and looking for somewhere cheaper. She reassured him that no one would think any less of him for doing so. \n\nAs for the Christmas situation, we’ve decided to cancel the gift swaps with the original group that wanted to do the White Elephant exchange. I’m planning to save the gifts I had for them and give them out on their birthdays instead. \n\nI’ve also made a big decision to step back from my family for a while and focus on moving forward with my plans to relocate my job to Zurich. I care about Dax and always will, but I need to start being less “selfless” and more “selfish” about my own life. \n\nDax is smart. He’ll figure things out. I’ll be there to support him emotionally and morally, but I’ve decided I can’t support him financially anymore. \n\nThanks to everyone who’s followed along and offered advice. I’ve made another big decision to check myself into therapy to address the depression and mental health struggles I’ve been ignoring for years. It’s time to stop pushing that aside and finally deal with it. \n\nTake care, everyone. \n\n**THIS IS A REPOST SUB - I AM NOT THE OOP** \n\n**DO NOT CONTACT THE OOP's OR COMMENT ON LINKED POSTS, REMEMBER - RULE 7**", "author": "Direct-Caterpillar77", "time": "2024-12-06 05:00:02", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/BestofRedditorUpdates/comments/1h7too9/wibita_for_not_wanting_to_participate_in_my/", "label": "", "entities": [["WIBITA", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["BoRU", "PERSON"], ["Nov 2, 2024", "DATE"], ["last night", "TIME"], ["22", "CARDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["50", "MONEY"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["WIBTA", "ORG"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["last year", "DATE"], ["Salem", "GPE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["about 90%", "PERCENT"], ["around 10%", "PERCENT"], ["White Elephant", "ORG"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["the end of the day", "DATE"], ["December", "DATE"], ["Nov 27, 2024** \n\nSo", "DATE"], ["WIBTA", "ORG"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["22", "CARDINAL"], ["Leaf", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["27F", "CARDINAL"], ["79F", "CARDINAL"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["22F", "CARDINAL"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["23F)—who", "CARDINAL"], ["A few days ago", "DATE"], ["Grandma", "PERSON"], ["Last year", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "GPE"], ["This year", "DATE"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["Mom", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["1", "CARDINAL"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan and Blaire", "ORG"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["second", "ORDINAL"], ["last-minute", "TIME"], ["Maeve", "PERSON"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["over $300", "MONEY"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Secret Santa", "PERSON"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Maeve", "GPE"], ["Mom", "GPE"], ["Stepdad", "PERSON"], ["Grandma", "PERSON"], ["Enter Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["Edie", "PERSON"], ["Tatum", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Team Christmas Spirit", "FAC"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Maeve", "ORG"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Nov 28, 2024** \n\nHoly freakin", "DATE"], ["Santa", "GPE"], ["last year", "DATE"], ["this year", "DATE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["Blaire", "PERSON"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["two", "CARDINAL"], ["seven years ago", "DATE"], ["two years", "DATE"], ["Nov 29, 2024", "DATE"], ["Reddit", "GPE"], ["Dax", "PERSON"], ["Victorian", "NORP"], ["Christmas", "DATE"], ["the White Elephant", "ORG"], ["Zurich", "GPE"], ["years", "DATE"], ["REPOST", "ORG"], ["OOP", "ORG"]]}

{"id": "P061", "type": "post", "text": "Nicki Minaj has been coming for Megan Thee Stallion on Twitter for 3 days straight We had threads like this for other beefs, so idk why there isn’t one rn. This is getting INSANE.\n\n# TRIGGER WARNING: SA/R**E\n\nMegan Thee Stallion released her new single on Thursday night\n\n**“Hiss”**: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVgCLQ\\_JQfU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvgclq_jqfu)\n\nThe song addresses a lot of people who have thrown shade towards her, including Drake. It contained one very deliberate, yet subliminal, diss at Nicki Minaj:\n\n***“These hoes don’t be mad at Megan, these hoes mad at Megan’s Law”***\n\n*“Megan’s Law”* is a federal law in the US requiring information on registered sex-offenders to be public.\n\nThis is a direct reference to, Nicki Minaj’s husband, Kenneth Petty who plead guilty to attempted rape, as well as facing a first-degree rape charge in 1994 against a 16 year-old while holding her at knife-point. He is now (after avoiding registration for multiple years,) a registered sex-offender. Nicki Minaj’s brother, Jelani Maraj, is also a sex-offender sentenced to 25 years to life for repeatedly raping his 11 year-old step-daughter.\n\nNicki has routinely defended both of them, and since the song’s release has been tweeting at Megan Thee Stallion almost every hour since Friday, even bringing up Megan’s deceased mother. She is also scheduled to release a diss track directed at Megan titled **“Big Foot”**, in reference to Megan being shot in the foot by Torey Lanez.\n\nLink to song announcement: [https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/1751514105125695571](https://twitter.com/nickiminaj/status/1751514105125695571)\n\nMegan meanwhile, has *not responded at all.*\n\nI know it’s been a known thing that Nicki is kinda off her rocker but this is reaching very sad and possibly drug-related heights.\n\nEDIT: Should also mention the announced track from Nicki is apparently produced by one of Megan’s main producers LilJu and was sent to Nicki 6 years ago. This is APPARENTLY part of the reason Nicki has not released her response-song yet, as they won’t clear it for her.\n\nNicki has also alleged that Megan tried to convince her to get an abortion (perhaps before she was even pregnant?). Which has backfired on her to a lot of people that say they would tell their friend to abort a sex-offender’s baby as well.\n\nEDIT 2: credit to u/vers_ace_bitch Nicki has thrown multiple subliminals at Megan, but this recent dig from Meg might be in response to the line Nicki rapped on **\"FTCU\"** off her new album: ***“Stay in your Tory Lane, bitch, I’m not Iggy”***\n\nEDIT 3: Nicki has dropped her response diss-track **“Big Foot”**:\n\nSounds very thrown together, Nicki is straight slurring and saying nonsense for a lot of it. She also has a line questioning why Megan is *“humpin a minor”*, very ironic. Also multiple bars attempting to discredit Megan being shot by Tory Lanez, claiming she *“lied on her dead momma”* about it.\n\nEDIT 4: Popular blogger KenBarbie, who was mentioned in Nicki’s track **“Big Foot”**, responds:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/itsKenBarbie/status/1751852496920711208\n\nClaims Nicki is heavily in debt, and basically touring for free to recover from it. Also alleges that  her husband is feeding her various drugs to keep her in a manic state so he can continue to spend her money.\n\nEDIT 5: Fans of Nicki have doxxed most of Megan’s team, and posted the address of Megan’s late-mother’s grave in order to vandalize it. Nicki went live on Twitter, ranting mostly, but subtly acknowledging this and threatening to “give the word”.\n\nhttps://x.com/khiitho_/status/1751787704835043620?s=46&t=srVlqKnQe_uokJEwzD9mmw", "author": "PoptartToaster", "time": "2024-01-29 01:16:52", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/hiphopheads/comments/1adiscw/nicki_minaj_has_been_coming_for_megan_thee/", "label": "", "entities": [["Nicki Minaj", "PERSON"], ["Megan Thee Stallion", "ORG"], ["3 days", "DATE"], ["INSANE", "ORG"], ["TRIGGER", "PERSON"], ["Thursday", "DATE"], ["night", "TIME"], ["Drake", "PERSON"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Nicki Minaj:", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan’s Law", "FAC"], ["Megan’s Law", "WORK_OF_ART"], ["US", "GPE"], ["Nicki Minaj’s", "PERSON"], ["Kenneth Petty", "PERSON"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["1994", "DATE"], ["16 year-old", "DATE"], ["multiple years", "DATE"], ["Nicki Minaj’s", "PERSON"], ["Jelani Maraj", "PERSON"], ["25 years", "DATE"], ["11 year-old", "DATE"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Megan Thee Stallion", "ORG"], ["almost every hour", "TIME"], ["Friday", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Torey Lanez", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["one", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["LilJu", "PERSON"], ["6 years ago", "DATE"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["2", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Meg", "ORG"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Tory Lane", "PERSON"], ["3", "CARDINAL"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Tory Lanez", "PERSON"], ["4", "CARDINAL"], ["KenBarbie", "ORG"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Claims Nicki", "PERSON"], ["5", "CARDINAL"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Nicki", "PERSON"], ["Twitter", "PERSON"]]}

{"id": "P064", "type": "post", "text": "Coachella’s parent company is donating major cash to a political organization pushing anti-abortion agenda Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/coachella-aeg-republican-donation-1385947/\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation — which owns concert giant AEG Live and its subsidiary Goldenvoice — gave $75,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association days after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nOn June 24, the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the Republican Attorneys General Association reached out to its supporters with an urgent plea for money: “[E]very donation will help Republican Attorneys General combat the Democrats’ pro-abortion agenda and stand tall for life.”\n\nSeveral days later, on June 29, according to a filing submitted to the IRS in July, the Anschutz Corporation — a massive holding company that famously owns the live music giant AEG Presents, the parent company of several major festivals, including Coachella — made a donation of $75,000 to RAGA. The money from Anschutz Corporation comes as RAGA gears up for election season with the aim of installing Attorneys General who will enforce and champion anti-abortion laws in key states where abortion rights remain in limbo, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida.\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation denies that it or its owner received, saw, or was aware of the RAGA fundraising solicitation, noting in a statement to Rolling Stone that they have been donating to RAGA since 2014 and that “[a]s a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.”\n\nRAGA’s opposition to abortion rights is well-established. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a member of RAGA, was in charge of the legal strategy to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court case that overturned Roe. In July 2021, 24 of the 26 other members of RAGA submitted an amicus brief in support of Fitch. “The Court’s abortion precedent is erroneous, inconsistent, uneven, and unreliable,” the Republican Attorneys General wrote. “Roe and Casey should be overruled.” (The only current members of RAGA that didn’t sign the brief were New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who assumed office in April 2021, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who was elected after the brief was signed.)\n\nAEG Presents and its subsidiary, Goldenvoice (which presents Coachella and Stagecoach), are just a couple of stars in the massive galaxy that is Anschutz Corporation’s holdings. Still, it is notable that Anschutz revenues will be used by RAGA to support these efforts, when part of that revenue is driven by ticket sales to concerts and festivals headlined by major artists who have been fiercely critical of conservative attacks on reproductive rights.\n\nAfter a draft opinion of Dobbs leaked back in May, at least 15 artists who performed at Coachella this year — including Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, and Phoebe Bridgers — signed a full-page ad in The New York Times condemning the Court’s actions. “Our power to plan our own futures and control our own bodies depends on our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion,” the artists said in the ad. “We will not back down — and we will not go back.”\n\nAfter the actual ruling was handed down, Harry Styles, another Coachella 2022 headliner, wrote on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the decision. Eilish, who performed at Glastonbury in the U.K. the day the decision was announced, told the crowd, “Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US.” And Megan Thee Stallion also used her Glastonbury platform to proclaim, “And I want to have it on the motherfucking record that the hot boys and the hot girls do not support this bullshit that y’all campaign for. My body is my motherfucking choice.”\n\nOther Coachella 2022 performers who spoke out against the Dobbs ruling, or have supported pro-choice efforts in the past, include Maggie Rogers, Finneas, Arcade Fire, and Kim Petras. Beyond Coachella, the outspoken artist Maren Morris also played the AEG/Goldenvoice country festival Stagecoach this year (Brandi Carlile, who criticized the Dobbs decision, was scheduled to play Stagecoach too, but had to cancel due to Covid-19). And politically-minded acts like Halsey, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow are playing AEG’s Firefly Festival in Dover, Delaware in September.\n\nReps for Styles, Eilish, Finneas, Megan Thee Stallion, Arcade Fire, Morris, Halsey, Carlile, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow did not immediately return requests for comment; Petras, Rogers, and Bridgers were not immediately available for comment, according to their representatives.\n\nIn a statement to Rolling Stone, AEG responded as follows: “AEG, AEG Presents, Goldenvoice and its other subsidiaries, as one company, stands firmly in support of a woman’s right to choose. As owner and producer of many of the most inclusive festivals and venues on the planet, we have taken strides to make our position on this clear.  On June 28, in the wake of the troubling overturning of Roe v. Wade and with the full support of The Anschutz Corporation, we informed all our employees that we will be covering travel and lodging expenses for women who need to leave their home state for reproductive health services including abortion. We remain, as ever, committed to choice, freedom, and access to full reproductive health options for women.”\n\nIn March 2022, records show that the Anschutz Corporation also contributed a combined $750,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund and the House Leadership Fund — super PACs seeking to put Republicans back in control of the House and Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell has said that, if his party regains control of Congress, he would consider a national abortion ban.\n\nThat the Anschutz Corporation donated $75,000 to RAGA, and larger amounts to other Republican committees, should not be a surprise. The company — which is owned by 82-year-old billionaire Philip Anschutz — has garnered plenty of attention and notoriety in the past for donations to right-wing groups, though his representatives have noted that he has also given to many other groups and tell Rolling Stone he does not “review or support each of the positions” taken by these groups.\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation’s statement, in full, reads: “As a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.  Neither The Anschutz Corporation (TAC), or Mr. Anschutz, received, saw or was aware of a Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) fundraising solicitation based on the reversal of Roe v. Wade.  TAC has contributed to RAGA since at least 2014. No contribution to RAGA by TAC or Mr. Anschutz has been based upon, informed by, or motivated by any RAGA position on Roe or abortion. Mr. Anschutz makes contributions to numerous organizations, usually for specific reasons. He does not review or support each of the positions taken by such organizations.”\n\nIn 2017, Anschutz was criticized after his foundation reportedly donated to anti-LGBTQ groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Christian Foundation, and the Family Research Council. Anschutz denied accusations that he was anti-LGBTQ, calling the claims “fake news,” and adding, “I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation.”\n\nAt the time, Anschutz said he would stop funding any groups involved in anti-LGBTQ activities. And while contributions to the aforementioned groups did stop, Pitchfork reported in 2018 that Anschutz was still giving money to smaller organizations with a history of anti-LGBTQ statements and activities. Among them were the popular Christian youth ministry Young Life which, as of last year was welcoming LGBTQ youth, but not allowing them to serve as volunteers or staff members. (Following Pitchfork’s report, a lawyer for Anschutz said, “We are proud of the progress we have made in this regard, but there is always room for improvement.”)\n\nLike many corporations after the Dobbs ruling, AEG promised last month to cover travel and lodging expenses for employees whose access to reproductive healthcare is under threat. “We understand that the issue of reproductive rights is deeply important to our employees, and we are committed to supporting you and your family with healthcare that continues to provide medical and prescription coverage for reproductive health services including abortions,” the company wrote in an email viewed by Rolling Stone.\n\nThe upcoming election in Wisconsin is a clear example of how critical Attorneys General races will be in a post-Roe world. The state’s current AG, Democrat Josh Kaul, has said he would “not investigate or prosecute” anyone in violation of the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which remained on the books, but was not enforced, after Roe was decided in 1973. Kaul also recently sued to block the ban after it was triggered by Dobbs.\n\nThe three Republicans aiming to unseat Kaul this November have all said they would enforce the state’s abortion ban if elected. And regardless of who wins the Republican primary for AG next month, the Republican Attorneys General Association will be ready to provide help, having already reserved $682,250 in TV ad time for spots opposing Kaul to run in October and November.", "author": "YoureASkyscraper", "time": "2022-07-26 02:25:03", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/w87k1w/coachellas_parent_company_is_donating_major_cash/", "label": "", "entities": [["Coachella", "ORG"], ["Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/coachella-aeg-republican-donation-1385947/\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation", "LAW"], ["AEG Live", "ORG"], ["Goldenvoice", "ORG"], ["75,000", "MONEY"], ["the Republican Attorneys General Association", "ORG"], ["Roe v.

I 24 female, my niece 5 female, and my sister-in-law Megan 25 female\n\nYesterday was my niece's birthday, my niece is my sister-in-law's first born, and my sister in law in currently Pregnant with her fourth child. \n\nWhen I received the invention to the party there was a note asking everyone to not forget about the mommy when shopping for birthday gifts. That my nieces birthday was also meant to celebrate the woman who carried her for nine months. \n\nI will be honest I’m not Megan's biggest fan, I’ve always found her to be a large drama queen. So when I read that I was supposed to bring her a present to her daughter's birthday party I was annoyed and knew I would be doing no such thing. \n\nFor my Nieces birthday, I made her a large wool hand-crocheted blanket and matching teddy bear. When it came time to open gifts it was Megan sitting on a chair in the center of the living room with my nieces sitting on the floor next to her. Megan opened every single present even the ones meant for my niece. It was only after she was done she would hand the open present to my niece.\n\nWhen it came time to open my present I watch as Megan open my gift, shuffled past the teddy bear and blanket, and proceeded to search for “her gift”. When Megan found no other present she looked up and asked me if there was another present from me in the pile, I responded “No”. \n\nDisappointed Megan took the blanket out of the box and proceeded to ask me questions like “where did you get such a cute blanket” and “I hope you didn’t break the bank with such an extravagant present”. Her tone of voice came across as sincere but the way she stared at me across the room definitely gave me a different impression. \n\nI responded to her questions by saying that I made the teddy bear and blanket myself and that it was no trouble for my little niece. Megan chuckles and asks me in front of the whole party if I had actually made the gifts, I responded absolutely. Megan and I go back and forth in front of everyone for a minute but Megan ends the conversation by saying I didn’t actually make the gifts because I didn’t collect the wool for the blanket or make the buttons on the bear myself. That for something to be handmade you have to use only your hands from start to fish otherwise it doesn’t count.                                \n\nAfter my MIL pulled me aside, she was extremely upset with me for antagonizing Megan. No one in the family likes Megan but my in-laws play nice because when they didn’t Megan and her husband moved halfway across the country, they just recently moved back to town. After my MIL thoroughly lectured me on “keeping the peace” she asked me to leave the party, go buy Megan a present, and to come back when I am ready with an apology. \n\nInstead, I left the party and took my presents with me. All-day today I have been playing telephone with friends and relatives of Megan. All of them accusing me of ruining my niece's birthday party and telling me I’m an AH for stealing my niece's birthday presents.\n\nEdit: My intentions for taking the present was to rewrap the gift and give it to my niece one on one so she could actually open a birthday present. After her mom opened the present she put it back in the box and back on the table she didn’t actually give the gift to my niece.", "author": "Bearwear671", "time": "2022-07-11 15:54:39", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vwlpih/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_5_year_old_nieces/", "label": "", "entities": [["AITA For Walking Out", "ORG"], ["Old Nieces Birthday Party & Taking Her Present With Me", "ORG"], ["24", "CARDINAL"], ["25", "CARDINAL"], ["Yesterday", "DATE"], ["first", "ORDINAL"], ["fourth", "ORDINAL"], ["nine months", "DATE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["a minute", "TIME"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["MIL", "ORG"], ["Megan", "GPE"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["Megan", "PERSON"], ["All-day", "DATE"], ["Megan", "GPE"]]}

{"id": "P073", "type": "post", "text": "Coachella’s parent company is donating major cash to a political organization pushing anti-abortion agenda Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/coachella-aeg-republican-donation-1385947/\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation — which owns concert giant AEG Live and its subsidiary Goldenvoice — gave $75,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association days after Roe v. Wade was overturned.\n\nOn June 24, the day the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the Republican Attorneys General Association reached out to its supporters with an urgent plea for money: “[E]very donation will help Republican Attorneys General combat the Democrats’ pro-abortion agenda and stand tall for life.”\n\nSeveral days later, on June 29, according to a filing submitted to the IRS in July, the Anschutz Corporation — a massive holding company that famously owns the live music giant AEG Presents, the parent company of several major festivals, including Coachella — made a donation of $75,000 to RAGA. The money from Anschutz Corporation comes as RAGA gears up for election season with the aim of installing Attorneys General who will enforce and champion anti-abortion laws in key states where abortion rights remain in limbo, such as Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona, Ohio, and Florida.\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation denies that it or its owner received, saw, or was aware of the RAGA fundraising solicitation, noting in a statement to Rolling Stone that they have been donating to RAGA since 2014 and that “[a]s a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe.”\n\nRAGA’s opposition to abortion rights is well-established. Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch, a member of RAGA, was in charge of the legal strategy to eliminate the constitutional right to an abortion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the Supreme Court case that overturned Roe. In July 2021, 24 of the 26 other members of RAGA submitted an amicus brief in support of Fitch. “The Court’s abortion precedent is erroneous, inconsistent, uneven, and unreliable,” the Republican Attorneys General wrote. “Roe and Casey should be overruled.” (The only current members of RAGA that didn’t sign the brief were New Hampshire Attorney General John Formella, who assumed office in April 2021, and Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares, who was elected after the brief was signed.)\n\nAEG Presents and its subsidiary, Goldenvoice (which presents Coachella and Stagecoach), are just a couple of stars in the massive galaxy that is Anschutz Corporation’s holdings. Still, it is notable that Anschutz revenues will be used by RAGA to support these efforts, when part of that revenue is driven by ticket sales to concerts and festivals headlined by major artists who have been fiercely critical of conservative attacks on reproductive rights.\n\nAfter a draft opinion of Dobbs leaked back in May, at least 15 artists who performed at Coachella this year — including Billie Eilish, Megan Thee Stallion, and Phoebe Bridgers — signed a full-page ad in The New York Times condemning the Court’s actions. “Our power to plan our own futures and control our own bodies depends on our ability to access sexual and reproductive health care, including abortion,” the artists said in the ad. “We will not back down — and we will not go back.”\n\nAfter the actual ruling was handed down, Harry Styles, another Coachella 2022 headliner, wrote on Twitter that he was “devastated” by the decision. Eilish, who performed at Glastonbury in the U.K. the day the decision was announced, told the crowd, “Today is a really, really dark day for women in the US.” And Megan Thee Stallion also used her Glastonbury platform to proclaim, “And I want to have it on the motherfucking record that the hot boys and the hot girls do not support this bullshit that y’all campaign for. My body is my motherfucking choice.”\n\nOther Coachella 2022 performers who spoke out against the Dobbs ruling, or have supported pro-choice efforts in the past, include Maggie Rogers, Finneas, Arcade Fire, and Kim Petras. Beyond Coachella, the outspoken artist Maren Morris also played the AEG/Goldenvoice country festival Stagecoach this year (Brandi Carlile, who criticized the Dobbs decision, was scheduled to play Stagecoach too, but had to cancel due to Covid-19). And politically-minded acts like Halsey, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow are playing AEG’s Firefly Festival in Dover, Delaware in September.\n\nReps for Styles, Eilish, Finneas, Megan Thee Stallion, Arcade Fire, Morris, Halsey, Carlile, Green Day, Dua Lipa, Charli XCX, Yungblud, and Willow did not immediately return requests for comment; Petras, Rogers, and Bridgers were not immediately available for comment, according to their representatives.\n\nIn a statement to Rolling Stone, AEG responded as follows: “AEG, AEG Presents, Goldenvoice and its other subsidiaries, as one company, stands firmly in support of a woman’s right to choose. As owner and producer of many of the most inclusive festivals and venues on the planet, we have taken strides to make our position on this clear. On June 28, in the wake of the troubling overturning of Roe v. Wade and with the full support of The Anschutz Corporation, we informed all our employees that we will be covering travel and lodging expenses for women who need to leave their home state for reproductive health services including abortion. We remain, as ever, committed to choice, freedom, and access to full reproductive health options for women.”\n\nIn March 2022, records show that the Anschutz Corporation also contributed a combined $750,000 to the Senate Leadership Fund and the House Leadership Fund — super PACs seeking to put Republicans back in control of the House and Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell has said that, if his party regains control of Congress, he would consider a national abortion ban.\n\nThat the Anschutz Corporation donated $75,000 to RAGA, and larger amounts to other Republican committees, should not be a surprise. The company — which is owned by 82-year-old billionaire Philip Anschutz — has garnered plenty of attention and notoriety in the past for donations to right-wing groups, though his representatives have noted that he has also given to many other groups and tell Rolling Stone he does not “review or support each of the positions” taken by these groups.\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation’s statement, in full, reads: “As a personal matter, Philip F. Anschutz believes in a woman’s right to choose and did not support the reversal of Roe. Neither The Anschutz Corporation (TAC), or Mr. Anschutz, received, saw or was aware of a Republican Attorneys General Association (RAGA) fundraising solicitation based on the reversal of Roe v. Wade. TAC has contributed to RAGA since at least 2014. No contribution to RAGA by TAC or Mr. Anschutz has been based upon, informed by, or motivated by any RAGA position on Roe or abortion. Mr. Anschutz makes contributions to numerous organizations, usually for specific reasons. He does not review or support each of the positions taken by such organizations.”\n\nIn 2017, Anschutz was criticized after his foundation reportedly donated to anti-LGBTQ groups including the Alliance Defending Freedom, the National Christian Foundation, and the Family Research Council. Anschutz denied accusations that he was anti-LGBTQ, calling the claims “fake news,” and adding, “I unequivocally support the rights of all people without regard to sexual orientation.”\n\nAt the time, Anschutz said he would stop funding any groups involved in anti-LGBTQ activities. And while contributions to the aforementioned groups did stop, Pitchfork reported in 2018 that Anschutz was still giving money to smaller organizations with a history of anti-LGBTQ statements and activities. Among them were the popular Christian youth ministry Young Life which, as of last year was welcoming LGBTQ youth, but not allowing them to serve as volunteers or staff members. (Following Pitchfork’s report, a lawyer for Anschutz said, “We are proud of the progress we have made in this regard, but there is always room for improvement.”)\n\nLike many corporations after the Dobbs ruling, AEG promised last month to cover travel and lodging expenses for employees whose access to reproductive healthcare is under threat. “We understand that the issue of reproductive rights is deeply important to our employees, and we are committed to supporting you and your family with healthcare that continues to provide medical and prescription coverage for reproductive health services including abortions,” the company wrote in an email viewed by Rolling Stone.\n\nThe upcoming election in Wisconsin is a clear example of how critical Attorneys General races will be in a post-Roe world. The state’s current AG, Democrat Josh Kaul, has said he would “not investigate or prosecute” anyone in violation of the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which remained on the books, but was not enforced, after Roe was decided in 1973. Kaul also recently sued to block the ban after it was triggered by Dobbs.\n\nThe three Republicans aiming to unseat Kaul this November have all said they would enforce the state’s abortion ban if elected. And regardless of who wins the Republican primary for AG next month, the Republican Attorneys General Association will be ready to provide help, having already reserved $682,250 in TV ad time for spots opposing Kaul to run in October and November.", "author": "DeneseTipton", "time": "2022-10-13 02:39:46", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/y2n5up/coachellas_parent_company_is_donating_major_cash/", "label": "", "entities": [["Coachella", "ORG"], ["Article: https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/coachella-aeg-republican-donation-1385947/\n\nThe Anschutz Corporation", "LAW"], ["AEG Live", "ORG"], ["Goldenvoice", "ORG"], ["75,000", "MONEY"], ["the Republican Attorneys General Association", "ORG"], ["Roe v.

{"id": "P076", "type": "post", "text": "OOP asks if he's the AH for checking his blood sugar at his desk when his coworker has a severe blood phobia. ***I am NOT OP, this is a repost. Original [post](https://ps.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/mkps8k/aita_for_checking_my_blood_sugar_at_my_desk_when/) from r/AmITheAsshole by u/independentask42***\n\n---\n\n\n**AITA for checking my blood sugar at my desk when my coworker has a severe blood phobia? - originally posted 05 Apr 2021**\n\nI (24M) enjoy my job and have two coworkers, Megan (25F) and our new coworker James (23M) who just started. The three of us each have our own office space, but because we have to frequently collaborate on work throughout the day we are often at each other’s desks.\n\nI am a type 1 diabetic, I give insulin and check my blood sugar throughout the day as needed. I give insulin through a pump so that’s not an issue. Checking my blood sugar involves pricking my finger to draw a drop of blood, the blood gets sucked up into a test strip that is connected to a glucose meter, and the meter displays the reading. The whole process takes like 10 seconds.\n\nI was checking my blood sugar in my office right when James walked over. Immediately, his face went white, he looked like he was about to puke or faint or maybe both. I was like, dude are you okay? He told me that he has a major blood and needle phobia and gets therapy for it. I explained what I was doing and why it was necessary and he said it’s “freaky” that I have to MAKE myself bleed multiple times a day. He told me he never wants to accidentally walk in on me checking my blood sugar again because he could pass out. I said that if I’m checking my blood sugar and hear him coming over I can call out a warning like “give me a sec!”. He said that won’t work, just knowing that I’m doing that just before he comes over is enough to freak him out, and that he would be stressed that I might not hear him walking over.\n\nHe told me I should check it in the bathroom from now on. I told him that I don’t think I should have to do that and it’s unsanitary. He said another option was if I only check my blood sugar at certain times, say 9am, 12pm before eating lunch, and 4pm, that way he’d know when to avoid me. I said these things can’t always be predicted, I’ll need to check if I feel my blood sugar going high or low.\n\nHe said he understands that I have diabetes but that he also has a special need (his blood phobia) that needs to be accommodated and that he doesn’t want to have to avoid me at work and only talk to Megan for fear he might see me checking again. He said he’ll talk to HR about this and that he’ll tell them that I refused to compromise with him.\n\nThat was last Thursday before the holidays, tomorrow I’m thinking of going to talk to HR before James does, but first I need to know that I’m in the right here. So AITA for not being more accommodating of James’ blood/needle phobia and checking my blood sugar as needed at my desk.\n\nedit: To clarify something, James cannot see me test my blood sugar unless he is literally standing in my doorway. It's not a communal-style workplace. I do not test in common areas, only in my office.\n\n\n**Verdict:** NTA\n\n\n**Helpful comments**\n\n\n>Is your HR decent or incompetent? Because if they're decent you should go in to talk to them, lay out what happened, tell them exactly what you need (to be able to check your sugar when needed in a convenient and sanitary space?) and then say \"My needs and his are clearly in conflict; how do you propose we solve it?\" That approach has the added advantage of you coming across as cool-headed, cooperative, and a problem solver, but mostly it means you clearly communicate your needs so you don't have to shoot down unworkable suggestions one by one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n>HR here. Assuming you are in the US at an employer of sufficient size to fall under the ADA, you both are in need of accommodation.\nAssuming his phobia limits a major life function, you are BOTH entitled to accommodation. if you go to hr, which you probably should, you will both probably have to go through the Ada process, which includes getting certification from your doctors to verify that your disorders constitute a disability under the law. This means that your condition impacts a major life function. It will be very easy to prove with diabetes. I don't know if his therapist will consider this to be a disability requiring him to have warning before entering. His therapist May recommend instead that he get 5 minute break if it happens to deal with his anxiety. She may not recommend avoidance.\nthat being said, if she does recommend avoidance as his therapist, you may be required to shut your door or put up a sign or something similar in order to make that accommodation. You do not need to do it in the bathroom. That would be unsanitary. However, it is very likely you would need to accommodate his disability as well. everybody saying that your disability trumps his disability is ultimately unimportant because the law protects both of you, and it is going to be reasonable to find an accommodation that will accommodate both of you. And it is the employer's responsibility to do that if you both seek Ada accommodation.\n\n\n**[UPDATE](https://ps.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nnqjzz/update_aita_for_checking_my_blood_sugar_at_my/) - posted 29 May 2021**\n\nI’m really glad I posted, it gave me the reassurance I needed that I was doing the right thing going to HR. I took your guy’s advice on how to approach the conversation with HR. I said that me and my coworker have conflicting medical needs and I could use advice on a solution that would work for both of us. The HR lady said that I have every right to continue to test my blood sugar in my office. When I told her that James suggested I test only at specific times of the day, her eyes got really big and she was like, “NO. Do not test your blood sugar on a schedule suggested to you by your coworker. Only your doctor.”\n\nLater HR spoke to James as well. Here’s what we agreed to with HR:\n-James is to call me on the phone before coming to my office. As in, “Hey, can I come ask a question?” and I say sure and ensure I’m not checking my blood sugar at that moment.\n-I cannot test my blood sugar in front of James. I wasn’t doing this anyway.\n-If James’ phobia symptoms are triggered for whatever reason, he is entitled to a ten-minute break to let his symptoms subside, in addition to the normal breaks we all get.\n\nThis system worked great...for a week. One day he called as usual, I said sure come over, but then he...didn’t come over. After about ten minutes I actually needed to check my blood sugar but thought with my luck he’d walk in at the exact moment I was testing. I ended up calling him back and he said that he got distracted and forgot he had a question for me. A few days later it happened again, and I was a bit annoyed that twice I delayed testing because I thought he was going to be entering my office at any second.\n\nSoon after I found out that James had put in his two-week notice. He explained that me being diabetic wasn’t the only reason why he was quitting, he wanted different hours etc, but that it did play a role. Later, Megan (our other coworker) told me that James told her that he really struggled with me being diabetic. For example, even just thinking, “I need to ask a question, but I have to call first to make sure he’s not checking his blood sugar” was distressing to him because then he’d be thinking about it, which would make him feel queasy and anxious.\n\nJames has quit now. While I’m relieved that I don’t have to feel like a leper at work anymore, I mostly just feel bad for James. It must be awful living with a phobia that severe and I know he didn’t choose to be that way. I hope he continues to see his therapist and can improve.\n\nSo I guess this doesn’t have a happy ending because ultimately we couldn’t work it out and he quit.\n\n---\n\n**I am not the original poster.

{"id": "P079", "type": "post", "text": "Megathread: Romain Molina's (The Guardian, NY Times) claims from Thursday's Twitter Space. The following is a non-exhaustive list of some of the claims made by investigative journalist Romain Molina (published in The Guardian, New York Times) in his most recent Twitter Space. It is important to note that while Molina's word is not to be taken lightly, as his work has influenced multiple FAs and officials in the past, this is not an official release on his part.\n\n* Elye Wahi (Montpellier striker) wasn't fired from SM Caen's youth setup for physically assaulting a supervisor at the academy. Instead, after physical threats, he brought over some secondary school friends in the washrooms to undress and masturbate in front of him.\n* 400+ players currently playing in the Premier League, Championship, Ligue 1, and Ligue 2 have been raped multiple times in their youth. Some of them have contracted anal injuries and/or diseases, and have gone to specialized clinics as a result. This is a two-decade-old issue, the first story will come out in December.\n* Megan Rapinoe wasn't bothered by Haitian girls getting raped. She prefers 'earning money' over 'defending these young girls'.\n* A Ligue 1 team covered up a pedophilia scandal in their youth academy by brainwashing the player by the time law enforcement was involved. Then, they sent the young player in question back to his country (he was a foreigner).\n* One of the largest academies in DR Congo is currently managed by a pedophilia ring.\n* An international coach was 'caught red-handed' after raping two 13 year-old girls in the middle of a tournament. His employer, a large media, fired him under other pre-tenses in 2017. This issue is especially concerning for 'us, as French people'. A famous, very well-liked personality participated in covering up this story as well.\n* Ferland Mendy hit a woman, knocked her to the ground, kicked her in the head, before showing her his genitals. She was taken to the emergency room after suffering head trauma. He also assaulted another woman. The player's club covered up the story in order to sell him the following year.\n* Some international games in Asia are fixed. Many players have stopped joining their national teams because of this.\n* Paris Saint-Germain has been conceding burn-out after burn-out. Over 100 employees have left the club in the last year alone. Leonardo is hated because of his behaviour/attitude.\n* The 'boss of Colombia's refereeing' is a pedophile. Molina has a complaint from a 12 year-old, which he can barely read in its entirety because it's 'gut-wrenching'.\n* Alexandre Benalla (French 'personality') has been trying to get involved in PSG for years. He fought with some of Nasser's entourage.\n* A consultant from *L'Équipe* has been involved in 'some shady stuff' in the transfer market.\n* Some very important people bend over backwards to get in touch with people close to Nasser Al Khelaïfi.\n* Most African FA presidents get paid prostitutes, or have their daughters' studies covered in other countries.\n* At Arsenal, all the players inhale nitrous oxide. A player came back to celebrate his birthday in Paris under the theme \"nitrous oxide balloons\".\n* A French international organized parties where he would defecate in women's mouths and film himself while doing it. He forced a girl, who later on sought to issue a formal complaint, to participate. Someone offered Molina a video, which he declined to see.\n* A Saudi consortium was never involved in the takeover of Olympique de Marseille.\n* The French FA pushes some of its people to coach national teams in Africa. They already did it with Didier Six, for example, and Guinea (note: he also coached Togo and Mauritius in the past).\n* Leonardo is hated in PSG. His signing of Icardi was not well-received by the coach at the time.\n* The massive media outrage surrounding the Qatar World Cup is political and financed by people/organizations who wish harm upon the country.\n* The son of Congo-Brazzaville's president is involved in the national team. In the Central African Republic, Kondogbia is friends with the president.\n* 80% of players smoke shisha. At one point in time, PSG players used to bring their shisha/hookah with them on away games. Blaise Matuidi regularly smoked shisha, but things still worked out for him.\n* The leagues in most Southeast Asian, Eastern European, and Latin American countries are fixed. Ireland, Malta, and Gibraltar also have 'lots' of matchfixing.\n* A former French international was involved in a 'go-fast' (smuggling drugs and/or other products in another country). His club's president 'saved his ass'.\n* FIFA claims to push for women's football, but does very little to protect the girls/women from abuse. It's rampant everywhere, on a global scale.\n* Morocco can 'shit on the ground' if they want, they have a large influence at CAF. They can 'do whatever they want'.\n* In the long-term, Tony Parker should take over the OL Group.\n* Kenya's FA has 16 bank accounts, including some 'hidden' accounts, when most FAs have one or two.\n* Amiens (Ligue 2) is \\[a circus\\]. On the way back from their away game at Ajaccio, everybody smelled like alcohol. The players love booze, shisha, drunken nights.\n* After Senegal complained against an overaged player in a U17 African team they faced, the national team declared the player as 'deceased'. He is currently continuing his career in the U21 national team of the same country.\n* A minor was raped and forced into an abortion at an \"international center of FIFA\".\n* East Timor eliminated Mongolia by paying Brazilian players to play for its national team.\n* Friends of the former Algerian FA president are waging war against the current leadership.\n* The Sierra Leone FA faked COVID tests throughout the entirety of the pandemic, most notably in its qualifier against Benin. Other nations and/or clubs are suspected to have forged documents as well, but this is not confirmed.\n* Mario Lemina received a handsome sum of money for representing Gabon. Other African players are also in similar positions.\n* EDIT: A player from Spezia has disappeared. The affair is linked with human trafficking issues and an academy founded in Nigeria by the club's president.
