{"id": "P005", "text": "I've read through parts of the Big Beautiful Bill. Here's what it actually does (without all the political noise attached to it) 1. What BBB means for immigration:\n\n• Gives ICE unprecedented amounts of money (day and night increase from previous funding amounts).\n\n• The doomers were wrong (so far). There is NO removal of habeas corpus, Fourth-Amendment warrants, or immigration-court jurisdiction limitations.\n\n• It gives power and purse control of ICE/DHS to Secretary of Homeland Security, so detention standards will now be made by Secretary Noem and detention conditions can now legally be pushed down to the statutory minimum.\n\nNoem has the final authority on pretty much everything now, so all prior standards or state licensing requirements for things related to deportations are void.\n\nThe bill even defines “family residential centers” as \"any DHS-run family detention facility regardless of whether the facility is licensed by a State.\"\n\nSo, yeah, a lot of power got centralized to POTUS, since Noem basically does whatever Trump/Miller tell her to do.\n\n• It rewards localities that turn their police into ICE auxiliaries and financially punishes those that don’t, pressuring “sanctuary” jurisdictions. Now, your local police force could essentially become a quasi ICE force as well.\n\n• People who are suspected of being an illegal alien by ICE/DHS are now kicked out of the country with a much narrower and quicker process!\n\nThe suspected person can still get an administrative review and can file habeas, but no status quo processes and other immigration judge reviews are required for the deportation to happen.\n\nWe don't know what a lot of this means in practice, but generally expect WAY more deportations with much less wiggle room, higher error rate and increased speed. Also expect bigger surveillance, more low quality detention centers, way less flexibility for migrants (illegal or legal) to make appeals etc...\n\n2. What BBB means for the economy:\n\n• Enacts short term economic relief/boost: no tax on tips and no tax on overtime (expires in 2028), and bigger employer child-care credit (permanent). This goes into effect by the end of 2025, and will start hitting real people during 2026 midterms (this was obviously politically calculated).\n\n• SNAP (“food-stamp”) rules tighten: work requirement age band widens to 17-65 and waivers become harder to get.\n\n• Medicaid gets new work/cost-sharing rules for adults just above the poverty line, allowing states to charge copays up to $35 per visit starting in 2028.\n\n• The narrative that $500 billion, AND $700 billion will be cut from Medicaid/Medicare is false. The two systems will be restructured and some cuts will be made, but from what I've read it doesn't even remotely amount to $500-$700 billion. \n\n• There's no hampering down on the rich or taxing them like some people have been saying. It's the opposite!\n\n37 % top rate is made permanent. Prevents the 39.6 % snap-back scheduled for 2026.\n\nPass-through (QBI) deduction rises from 20 % to 23 % and is made permanent.\n\nEstate-tax exemption jumps from $5 m to $15 m per person ($30 m per couple) from 2026 onward.\n\nTo summarize in plain English, for the next 3-4 years your average service worker might see $500-$1500 in savings per year, and then at the start of 2028 the entire thing flips back to the old playbook, meanwhile the rich get richer, and their financial benefits get cemented PERMENANTLY.\n\n• What Thomas Massie has been saying over the past few weeks appears to be correct. BBB massively pumps up federal debt, drives inflation, doesn't cement DOGE cuts, and is just generally fiscally irresponsible.\n\nAgain, it temporary boosts the working people so that Trump wins the good boy points through out his term. Everything resets for your working mom/dad in 2028 once he's out, while the billionaires remain happy, and actually get increased benefits.\n\n3. Rolls back almost all enforceable environmental protections\n\nClean Heavy-Duty Trucks (§ 132), Port Pollution Grants (§ 133), Greenhouse-Gas Reduction Fund (§ 134), Environmental-Justice Block Grants (§ 138), EPA multi-pollutant vehicle standards (§ 42201), and NHTSA CAFE standards (§ 42301) all got repealed and their funds rescinded.\n\nThere's way more here, but basically majority of the things Biden and previous administrations have passed for the environment got straight up slashed or massively reduced.\n\nNet 0 by 2050 is basically completely over at this point, if it wasn't already.\n\n4. Crushes federal injunctions/reviews of POTUS actions\n\n• Enforcement throttle – courts can issue orders but cannot back them with contempt without a Rule 65(c) bond (Sec 70302).\n\nThis basically means that people can complain about Trump all they want, and their cases can still be processed, BUT actual orders (TRO's) to stop the supposed illegal Trump actions are now going to require A LOT of money (called a bond), in order to be executed.\n\nFrom now on, Dems will have to pick and choose their battles in a more narrow way. So, we will likely see only major Trump violations get stopped, while a lot of other really bad things will go unchecked.\n\n• Forum & timing controls – exclusive appellate jurisdiction, 180-day filing windows, higher evidentiary burdens etc...\n\nBasically increases evidence requirements and shortens the timeframe where a case can be presented and pushed through the courtrooms, so lawyers have to move unrealistically fast to hold Trump accountable.\n\nThere's A LOT more, but I only skimmed the bill and wrote down things that caught my eye. There will likely be a lot more long threads from other people that will dive into other aspects of it.\n\nBBB is not as beautiful as Republicans say it is.", "highlighted_text": "I' ve read through parts of the big beautiful bill.

Cutting taxes without reducing spending puts our nation further into debt.  Because of congressional weakness and self-interest they are unable to be honest with the American people.  In other words the Big Beautiful bill despite all the talk about fiscal conservatism is the same old politics as usual and continues growing our national debt.\n\nI think the really scary part is that this was theoretically the best opportunity in DECADES to actually make a difference and get our financial house in order.  It is a failed opportunity.  Both parties have contributed about equally to the debt problem over the past 50+ years.  What makes it more dangerous than ever is the much higher interest rates that are never going back to the lows of prior years.
