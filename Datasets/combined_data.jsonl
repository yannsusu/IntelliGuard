The left protested while your team (the right) celebrated putting the drunken frat boy on SCOTUS so they could overturn Roe.

The party of men you voted for that continues to put fetal viability over your actual life. You. Voted. For. That. Purchase a mirror, ma‚Äôam and stare deeply into it. \n\nI suspect you know that YOU and ‚Äúthe right‚Äù are why you were put in danger, and this is your exercise in denial.
